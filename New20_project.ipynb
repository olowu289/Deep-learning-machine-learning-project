I hope to show that there\\nwas and is much room for a difference of opinion within the Order\\nitself, perhaps by testing the limits myself.\\n\\n\\nLet us examine this issue a bit more closely....\\n\\n\"In 1895, Karl Kellner (1850-1905), a wealthy Austrian industrialist\\nand paper chemist, as well as a high-grade Mason, founded the Ordo\\nTempli Orientis.  Kellner had traveled widely in the East, where he\\nmet three adepts who instructed him specific magical practices.  \\nKellner\\'s efforts to develop the Order were later assisted by Franz\\nHartmann, Heinrich Klein and Theodore Reuss, who had worked together\\nprior to joining the O.T.O.  The Order was first proclaimed in 1902\\nin Reuss\\'s Masonic publication, \\'Oriflamme\\'.  On Kellner\\'s death,\\nReuss succeeded him as Outer Head [O.H.O.].  The \\'Jubilee\\' edition of\\nthe \\'Oriflamme\\', published in 1912, announced that the Order taught\\nsecret of sexual magic.\\n \\n\"Theodore Reuss was an interesting character.  Born June 28, 1855 in\\nAugsburg, he entered Masonry in 1876.  He was a singer, journalist and\\npossibly a spy for the Prussian political police, infiltrating the Socialist\\nLeague founded by Karl Marx\\'s daughter and her husband.  Reuss was\\nlater associated with William Wynn Westcott, a leader of the Golden\\nDawn, who later introduced him to John Yarker.  Yarker chartered Reuss to\\nfound the Rites of Memphis and Mizraim in Germany.  After several\\nattempts to concretize various Masonic Rites, Reuss settled on the\\ndevelopment of the O.T.O.\\n\\n\"The Order experienced reasonably steady growth under Reuss\\' leadership.\\nFor example, he chartered Papus in France, Rudolph Steiner in Berlin\\nand H. Spencer Lewis in the USA.  In 1912, the historic meeting between\\nReuss and Crowley occurred.  Crowley wrote that Reuss came to him and\\naccused him of revealing Order secrets.  When Crowley looked at it afresh,\\nthe initiated interpretation of sexual magick unfolded itself to him for\\nthe first time.  Reuss appointed Crowley as Supreme and Holy King of all\\nthe English speaking world, and it was this authorization that he invoked\\nwhen publishing the material of the Equinox.\\n\\n\"Reuss resigned as Outer Head of the Order in 1922 after suffering a\\nstroke and named Crowley his successor.  All was well until 1925 when\\n_The Book of the Law_ was translated into German.  There was a break\\nin the continuity of the Order.  Manyk members split with the new O.H.O.\\nover the book, which Crowley was actively promulgating through the Order.\\nHe had earlier revise dthe Order rituals at Reuss\\'s request, deeply\\ninfusing the doctrines of the New Aeon revelation.\"\\n\\n_An Introduction to the History of the O.T.O._, by Ad Veritatem IX\\'\\n\\nWithin _Equinox III:10_, Edited by \\n  Hymenaeus Beta, Frater Superior, Rex Summus Sanctissimus,\\n    Caliph of the United States of America,\\n      Published by Samuel Weiser, 1990.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are many possible reasons that our Frater Superior included this\\nmaterial in _Equinox III:10_.  And this is the real point, is it not?\\nWhy did he wish to publish such things about the history of his own\\norganization?  Does he represent a dogmatic threat to the principle\\nof Thelema?  Or is he exercising his True Will and putting forth very\\ncomplex pictures with no easy answers?  A picture which leaves room\\nfor very many interpretations.\\n\\nIt is quite easy for me to see, for example, that all of O.T.O. derived\\nout of the dribble of faltering Masonry, purchased by clever hucksters\\nwith an ounce of courage and some writing ability to aid them.  And I\\ncan take that all the way down to our present Caliph, whose feeble\\nsupport of the \\'Law of Thelema\\' is laughable at best.\\n\\nWould I be thrown out of the Order for speaking in this way?  \\nWill I?  \\nI think not.\\nWhy?  Because my Frater will see it as a perspective, an interjection\\nI am using as an example.  My illustration shows that we may express things\\nin the context of a larger work and the true significance of this may be\\nquite difficult to apprehend at first.\\n\\nSo it may be with OTO and Merlinus X\\'.  Please look O.T.O. more carefully.\\nI do not support Reuss\\'s words myself, as I am not qualified to assess\\nthem, and I am critical of their pomposity.  If I who am a member of\\nthe Order take such a stand and am allowed to continue doing so, then\\nwhat can this say about the health of the Order?  Does it mean that\\nthe Order has \\'gone soft\\' and abandoned its moral principles?  Or\\ndoes it mean that it is strong in its ability to let the will of\\nuniversal kinship arise on its own, not shackled by some dogmatic\\nrequirement?  How shall we resolve these two possibilities?\\n\\n\\nI find a high calibre of individual associated with Ordo Templi Orientis.\\nThey are often quite intelligent and sometimes very well versed in arcane\\nor usual information.  They are quite often artists and geniuses.  \\nHaving met some 20 longstanding members in the SF Bay Area (many who are or\\nwere very heavily involved with the Order), I can vouch for the integrity\\nof the organization as it stands.\\n\\nI have sometimes questioned the policy of Hymenaeus Beta.  In these moments \\nI followed my intuition, and I\\'ve found little to stop me from requesting\\na Second initiation from a different O.T.O. body.  I\\'m happily participating\\nin social groups (Feasts or Initiations) and have come to know the Gnostic\\nMass well enough for my tastes.\\n \\n\\nThis doesn\\'t make me an authority on Order politics and explanations, however.\\nI can only hypothesize and relay to you what I understand based on my\\nlimited contact with other members.\\n\\nI urge you not to take the words of Merlinus X too far.  There are many\\nways to interpret words, and many people who have become involved with\\nthe Order feel very strongly about the sanctity of personal freedom\\nand the preservation of individual vision.\\n\\nI welcome other comment on this issue and will be writing more in response\\nto other posts in this thread.\\n\\n\\nInvoke me under my stars.

Miller (1939).\\n\\nThe reason for the phrase being there was to explain the rationale\\nbehind the amendment, which was this: by depending on the people to\\nbear arms in defense of the country, no centralization of military\\npower could ever occur which would permit tyranny -- in short, the\\ngovernment would remain perpetually in fear of the people, rather than\\nthe other way around.\\n\\n   \"No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms.

The concepts of \"right\"\\nand \"wrong\" (or \"correct/incorrect\" or \"true/false\") belong to the\\ndomain of epistemological rather than moral questions.  It makes no\\nsense to ask if a moral position is right or wrong, although it is\\nlegitimate to ask if it is good (or better than another position).\\n\\nLet me illustrate this point by looking at the psychological derivatives\\nof epistemology and ethics:  perception and motivation, respectively.\\nOne can certainly ask if a percept is \"right\" (correct, true,\\nveridical) or \"wrong\" (incorrect, false, illusory).  But it makes little\\nsense to ask if a motive is true or false.  On the other hand, it is\\nstrange to ask whether a percept is morally good or evil, but one can\\ncertainly ask that question about motives.\\n\\nTherefore, your suggested answers (a)-(c) simply can\\'t be considered:\\nthey assume you can judge the correctness of a moral judgment.\\n\\nNow the problem with (d) is that it is double-barrelled:  I agree with\\nthe first part (that the \"rightness\" of a moral position is a\\nmeaningless question), for the reasons stated above.  But that is\\nirrelevant to the alleged implication (not an implication at all) that\\none cannot feel peace is better than war.  I certainly can make\\nvalue judgments (bad, better, best) without asserting the \"correctness\"\\nof the position.\\n\\nSorry for the lengthy dismissal of (a)-(d).  My short (e) answer is\\nthat when two individuals grotesquely disagree on a moral issue,\\nneither is right (correct) or wrong (incorrect).

MEK has a\\nmethyl (CH3) on one side, and an ethyl (C2H5) on the other.  Acetone\\nhas two methyls.  So acetone is not methyl ethyl ketone, but instead\\nis dimethyl ketone.  Both solvents have similar properties.  I think\\nthat MEK may be a little less flammable but a lot worse to breathe.\\nIt's a lot harder to buy MEK than it once was.  Use acetone.\\n\\nNail polish remover consists almost entirely of acetone.

In general, if\\nyou have problems with sounds working when you play one per\\nchannel and then close the channel (with the related\\nslowdown), but then when you play more than one you don't\\nwork, then you are adding more than one synthesizer to a\\nchannel, possibly the same one multiple times. This might be\\nbecause you are calling SndPlay on a preexisting channel with\\na sound resource which adds the sampled sound synthesizer to\\nthe channel first thing before it plays. Most sampled sounds\\nhave this command at the start of them. You need to resedit\\nthe sound and remove that command, then when you create your\\nchannel, specify the sampled sound synthesizer to be the\\nchannel's synth. Then you can use asynch sndplay's all you\\nwant. You'll probably want to switch to BufferCmd's, since you\\nare going to have to use SndDoCommand anyway to add callbacks.\\n\\nNow before you go ahead and tell me I am full of it, and the\\nsound manager doesn't work for games, remember, Spectre uses\\nit. And it works great. If Spectre can spare the CPU time, you\\ncan too.\\n\\nOne little disclaimer: There are some out there who say the\\nSound Manager in the IIsi can't be made to work right.

A\\nlower court had banned the local Gideons, an international Bible-\\ndistribution group, from passing out Bibles to fifth-graders. The\\nACLU\\'s Barry Lynn was quoted as saying that the court\\'s action\\nprotected the \"religious neutrality of our public schools.\" He also\\nsaid that schools must serve students of \"all faiths and none.\"\\nSchools were not to be a \"bazaar where rival religious groups\\ncompete for converts,\" according to Lynn.\\n\\nSeveral Gideons, men who are responsible for putting Bibles in\\nhospitals and hotels, are members of our church. They tell of\\nsimilar stories where they are only allowed to distribute Bibles on\\nsidewalks around the schools, but cannot go inside the schools.\\nThey tell of mild harassment by parents who do not want their\\nchildren receiving a Bible from a stranger. They are willing to\\ncontinue their work at a distance, but find the school\\'s position\\nsomewhat disheartening.\\n\\nI understand rationally and logically the court\\'s position. And, I\\ncan see the sense of fairness for all groups. But, on the other\\nhand, when does \"neutrality\" become \"nihilism?\" When does plurality\\nturn into no position at all?\\n\\nI see a couple of ironies here. One is that we can pass out condoms\\nbut not Bibles in our schools. Think on that one for a moment.\\n\\nThe other is that while we are seeking \"religious neutrality\" in\\nour schools, countries like Russia--who, by the way, practiced\\n\"religious neutrality\" for the past seventy years--are making the \\nBible part of their public school curriculum. When I was in St.\\nPetersburg in March, the church we worked with had trained over 100\\npublic school teachers to teach the Bible, and the government had\\nrequested hundreds more! I recently heard a medical doctor who is\\npresident of the Gideon chapter in Moscow tell how they are eagerly\\ninvited to the University of Moscow to distribute Bibles to the\\nstudents and are given class time to explain its contents. I\\nremember seeing a photograph of this doctor holding a Bible and\\nspeaking to the university students standing under a statue of\\nLenin. Now, that\\'s ironic!\\n\\nI admit two things: 1) We are a pluralistic society, and all faiths\\nhave equal footing. This is what our country was founded on. 2) To\\nallow every group on school grounds could create a bazaar-like\\natmosphere. Each city must work to be inclusive of all religions\\nand provide a hearing for them. 3)--I know I said two--The vitality\\nof religious faith is not dependent upon whether or not the public\\narena acknowledges it as valid.\\n\\nHowever--and you knew this was coming--I believe, disallowing the\\ndistribution of the Bible by law-abiding, caring adults in our\\nschools only signals once again our culture\\'s movement away from a\\nsingular base from which we as individuals and as a nation can make\\nmoral and ethical decisions.\\n\\nWhat do you think? \\n\\n                         -= MAIL BOX =-\\n(Let me know if you do not want me to print your letter or your\\nname.)\\n\\nGood column [re: TIME coverstory about teen sexuality]; I agree\\nwith moral education from home, but some homes don\\'t have the kinds\\nof morals I want taught.

According\\n to documented information, 28 Muslim villages have been destroyed in the\\n aforementioned region, more than 2,000 people have been slaughtered,\\n many possessions and livestock have been seized, young Muslim women\\n have been taken to Kars and Gumru, thousands of women and children who\\n were able to flee their villages were beaten, raped and massacred in the\\n mountains, and this aggression against the properties, lives, chastity \\n and honour of the Muslims continued. It was the responsibility of the\\n Armenian Government that the cruelties and massacres be stopped in order \\n to alleviate the tensions of Muslim public opinion due to the atrocities \\n committed by the Armenians, that the possessions taken from the Muslims\\n be returned and that indemnities be paid, that the properties, lives,\\n and honour of the Muslims be protected.\"\\n\\n\\nSerdar Argic\\n\\n                           \\'We closed the roads and mountain passes that \\n                            might serve as ways of escape for the Turks \\n                            and then proceeded in the work of extermination.\\'\\n                                                  (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)\\n                           \\'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists \\n                            a single Turkish soul.\\' (Sahak Melkonian - 1920)\\n\\n',\n",

(hardware) printer adapters have the ability to disable\\n   the use of IRQ 7, usually by merely breaking the connection between\\n   the ISA pin and the associated driver.  Other adapters control the\\n   IRQ line by a tri-state driver, and by programming just leave it\\n   in the high-impedence mode.\\n\\n - Unfortunately, there are a lot of adapter cards which use bistate\\n   drivers (i.e., either assert high or assert low) for the IRQ lines\\n   rather than tristate drivers (assert high, assert low, or don't\\n   assert anything).  The presence of such a card on an IRQ line precludes\\n   the use of that IRQ by any other adapter unless it is physically \\n   disconnected by a jumper.\\n\\n   (Incidentally, note that there's no requirement that a card hold\\n   the IRQ line low when no interrupt is desired.

The article starts with \"A leader\\nof the NASA team in charge of redesigning the planned\\nspace station said yesterday the job is tough and may\\nbe impossible.\" O\\'Connor is quoted saying whether it is\\npossible to cut costs that much and still provide for\\nmeaningful research \"is a real question for me.\"\\nO\\'Connor said \"everything is fair game,\" including\\n\"dropping or curtailing existing contracts with the\\naerospace industry, chopping management of the space\\nstation program at some NASA facilities around the\\ncountry, working closely with the Russian space station\\nMir, and using unmanned Titan rockets to supplement the\\nmanned space shuttle fleet.\"\\n\\nO\\'Connor says his team has reviewed 30 design options\\nso far, and they are sorting the serious candidates\\ninto three categories based on cost.\\n\\nThe Post says O\\'Connor described the design derived\\nfrom the current SSF as a high cost option (I believe\\nKathy Sawyer, the Post writer, got confused here. I\\nlistened in on part of O\\'Connor\\'s briefing to the press\\non Monday, and in one part of the briefing O\\'Connor\\ntalked about how the White House wants three options,\\nsorted by cost [low, medium, and high]. In another part\\nof the briefing, he discussed the three teams he has\\nformed to look at three options [SSF derivative @ LaRC,\\nmodular buildup with Bus-1 @ MSFC, and Single Launch\\nCore [\"wingless Orbiter\"] @ JSC. Later, in response to\\na reporters question, I thought I heard O\\'Connor say\\nthe option based on a SSF redesign was a \"moderate\"\\ncost option, in between low & high cost options. Not\\nthe \"high cost\" option as Sawyer wrote).\\n\\nThe article goes on to describe the other two options\\nas \"one features modules that could gradually be fitted\\ntogether in orbit, similar to the Russian Mir. The\\nother is a core facility that could be deposited in\\norbit in a single launch, like Skylab.

Diplomats and aid\\nworkers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates.\\n\\nThe 25  February attack on Hojali  by Armenian forces was  one of\\nthe last moves  in their four-year campaign to  take full control\\nof Nagorny Karabakh,  the subject of a new  round of negotiations\\nin Rome on Monday. The bloodshed was something between a fighting\\nretreat and  a massacre, but  investigators say that most  of the\\ndead were civilians. The awful  number of people killed was first\\nsuppressed by  the fearful  former Communist government  in Baku.\\nLater  it  was blurred  by  Armenian  denials and  grief-stricken\\nAzerbaijan\\'s wild  and contradictory  allegations of up  to 2,000\\ndead.\\n\\nThe State Prosecuter, Aydin Rasulov,  the cheif investigator of a\\n15-man  team  looking  into  what Azerbaijan  calls  the  \"Hojali\\nDisaster\", said  his figure of 600  people dead was a  minimum on\\npreliminary  findings.  A similar  estimate  was  given by  Elman\\nMemmedov, the mayor of Hojali. An  even higher one was printed in\\nthe Baku newspaper  Ordu in May - 479 dead  people named and more\\nthan 200 bodies reported unidentified.  This figure of nearly 700\\ndead is quoted as official by Leila Yunusova, the new spokeswoman\\nof the Azeri Ministry of Defence.\\n\\nFranCois Zen  Ruffinen, head  of delegation of  the International\\nRed Cross  in Baku, said  the Muslim imam  of the nearby  city of\\nAgdam had reported a figure of  580 bodies received at his mosque\\nfrom  Hojali, most  of  them  civilians. \"We  did  not count  the\\nbodies. But  the figure seems  reasonable. It is no  fantasy,\" Mr\\nZen Ruffinen said. \"We have some idea since we gave the body bags\\nand products to wash the dead.\"\\n\\nMr  Rasulov endeavours  to give  an unemotional  estimate of  the\\nnumber of  dead in the  massacre. \"Don\\'t  get worked up.  It will\\ntake  several months  to  get a  final  figure,\" the  43-year-old\\nlawyer said at his small office.\\n\\nMr Rasulov  knows about these  things. It  took him two  years to\\nreach  a firm  conclusion that  131  people were  killed and  714\\nwounded  when  Soviet  troops  and tanks  crushed  a  nationalist\\nuprising in Baku in January 1990.\\n\\nThose  nationalists, the  Popular  Front, finally  came to  power\\nthree weeks  ago and  are applying pressure  to find  out exactly\\nwhat  happened when  Hojali, an  Azeri town  which lies  about 70\\nmiles from the border with Armenia, fell to the Armenians.\\n\\nOfficially, 184 people have so  far been certified as dead, being\\nthe  number of  people that  could be  medically examined  by the\\nrepublic\\'s forensic department. \"This  is just a small percentage\\nof the dead,\" said Rafiq Youssifov, the republic\\'s chief forensic\\nscientist. \"They were the only bodies brought to us. Remember the\\nchaos and the fact that we are  Muslims and have to wash and bury\\nour dead within 24 hours.\"\\n\\nOf these 184 people, 51 were women, and 13 were children under 14\\nyears old.  Gunshots killed  151 people,  shrapnel killed  20 and\\naxes or  blunt instruments  killed 10.  Exposure in  the highland\\nsnows killed the last three.  Thirty-three people showed signs of\\ndeliberate mutilation, including ears,  noses, breasts or penises\\ncut off and  eyes gouged out, according  to Professor Youssifov\\'s\\nreport. Those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of those\\nbelieved to have been killed, Mr Rasulov said.\\n\\nFiles  from  Mr  Rasulov\\'s  investigative  commission  are  still\\ndisorganised -  lists of 44  Azeri militiamen are dead  here, six\\npolicemen there,  and in handwriting  of a mosque  attendant, the\\nnames of  111 corpses brought to  be washed in just  one day.

Also, H2SO4\\nis in a water solution as 2H30+ and SO4--.  Thus the heats of formation of\\nPbSO4 and H2SO4 are for the most part irrelevant.\\n\\n>What is important to notice here is that the reaction, as you knew it would be,\\n>is exothermic, or energy discharging.\\n\\nAs it turns out the reaction is indeed exothermic (heat producing).\\n(More about this later.)\\n\\nWhat actually happens to make the battery completely useless is this:\\n(we\\'re talking lead-acid batteries of course)\\nThe battery slowly self discharges.  As this discharge takes place two things\\nhappen. -The level of Pb++ ions in the acid solution increases (i.e. the lead\\n           and lead oxide plates are dissolved).\\n        -The level of H30+ ions in the acid solution decreases (i.e. the solution\\n           becomes less acidic, or more like water if you like).\\nNow, as the post to which I am responding correctly stated, PbSO4 will precipitate\\nin a WATER (non-acid) solution.  When the battery dies (i.e. is fully discharged)\\nwe end up with a high concentration of Pb++ and SO4-- in water.  So PbSO4\\nforms in the solution and FALLS TO THE BOTTOM OF THE BATTERY (of course this\\nhappens in varying degrees, the more discharged, the more precipitate forms).\\n\\nThe precipitate forms a conductive layer on the bottom of the battery.  If\\nthere is enough of the lead and lead oxide plates left to touch the precipitate\\n(more common in a newer battery) a dead short results.\\n\\nI have seen products in automotive shops to correct this condition, but they\\nare for the most part useless.  They can dissolve the PbSO4 but cannot restore\\nthe lead and lead oxide plates properly.

A logical consequence of the above argument is this:\\n\"If you really want your car to start, lower the battery temperature to\\n -50 to \\'pull\\' the reaction along.\"  We all know from experience (at\\n least those of us in Canada do (it gets cold up here)) that this is\\nnot true.

You need to ask yourself some difficult questions:\\n1) is there an afterlife, and if so, does man require salvation to attain\\nit.  If the answer is yes, the next question is 2) how does man attain this\\nsalvation - can he do it on his own as the eastern religions and certain\\nmodern offshoots like the \"new age movement\" teach or does he require God\\'s\\nhelp?  3) If the latter, in what form does - indeed, in what form can such\\nhelp come?  Needless to say, this discussion could take a lifetime, and for\\nsome people it did comprise their life\\'s writings, so I am hardly in a\\nposition to offer the answers here - merely pointers to what to ask.

Well, Christ referred to God as \"My Father\",\\nnot \"My Mother\", and while the \"maleness\" of God is not the same as the\\nmaleness of those of us humans who possess a Y chromosome, it does not\\nhonor God to refer to Him as female purely to be trendy, non-discriminatory,\\nor politically correct.

The world now has almost 10\\n  times the proven oil reserves it had in 1950 and twice the reserves of\\n  1970. Proven reserves of coal and natural gas have increased just as\\n  dramatically.\\n\\n    When standards of living, population densities, and industrial\\n  structures are controlled for, the United States is no less energy\\n  efficient than Japan and more energy efficient than many of the Group\\n  of Seven nations.\\n\\n    Energy independence provides little protection against domestic oil\\n  price shocks because the energy economy is global. Moreover, since the\\n  cost of oil represents only about 2 percent of gross national product,\\n  even large increases in the price of oil would have little impact on the\\n  overall U.S. economy.\\n\\n    Market economies are, on average, 2.75 times more energy efficient per\\n  $1,000 of GNP than are centrally planned economies.\\n\\n    Utilities\\' subsidized energy-efficiency measurs, known as demand-side\\n  management programs, encourage free riders, overuse of competing resource\\n  inputs, an competitive inequities. Furthermore, DSM programs do not\\n  reduce demand.\\n\\n    Taylor concludes that government-mandated energy conservation imposes\\n  unnecessary costs on consumers and wastes, not conserves, energy; that\\n  subsidizing energy-conservation technologies will stymie, not advance,\\n  gains in energy conservation; and that central control over the lifeblood\\n  of modern society--energy--would transfer tremendous power to the state\\n  at the expense of the individual.\\n\\n    \"Energy Conservation and Efficiency: The Case Against Coercion\" is no.\\n  189 in the Policy Analysis series published by the Cato Institute, an\\n  independent public policy research organization in Washington, DC.\\n\\n\\n\\nAvailable from:\\n  Cato Institute\\n  224 Second Street SE\\n  Washington, DC  20003\\n\\n\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                        The Cato Institute\\n\\n    Founded in 1977, the Cato Institute is a public policy research\\n  foundation dedicated to broadening the parameters of policy debate\\n  to allow consideration of more options that are consistent with the\\n  traditional American principles of limited government, individual\\n  liberty, and peace.  To that end, the Institute strives to achieve\\n  greater involvement of the intelligent, concerned lay public in \\n  questions of policy and the proper role of government.\\n    The Institute is named for Cato\\'s Letters, libertarian pamphlets\\n  that were widely read in the American Colonies in the early 18th\\n  century and played a major role in laying the philosophical foundation\\n  of the American Revolution.\\n    Despite the achievement of the nation\\'s Founders, today virtually\\n  no aspect of life is free from government encroachment.  A pervasive\\n  intolerance for individual rights is shown by government\\'s arbitrary\\n  intrusions into private economic transactions and its disregard for\\n  civil liberties.\\n    To counter that trend the Cato Institute undertakes an extensive\\n  publications program that addresses the complete spectrum of policy\\n  issues.  Books, monographs, and shorter studies are commissioned\\n  to examine the federal budget, Social Security, regulation, military\\n  spending, international trade, and myriad other issues.  Major policy\\n  conferences are held throughout the year, from which papers are\\n  published thrice yearly in the Cato Journal.\\n    In order to maintain its independence, the Cato Institute accepts\\n  no government funding.

Have an open mind.  And so end the mockery.  Gain \\nknowledge of the real God.  Put your presumptions aside.  Read the\\nBible and know that there is, truly is, a reason for everything and\\nthere exists a God that has so much love for you that the depth of it goes beyond\\nour shallow worldly experience.  A person who commits himself  \\nto seeking God, will find God.  Jesus stands at your door and knocks.  But a\\nperson who half-heartedly opens the Bible, or opens it with purpose to find \\nsomething to mock, will find, learn and see nothing.  The only thing one\\nwill gain with that attitude is folly.\\n\\nBe careful to not jump the gun, for at first glance, there are many passages\\nin the Bible that will seem bizarre and absurd.  Be assured that even\\nthough they seem alien at first, be confident that they are not.\\nBe assured that beyond your present comprehension, there lies such\\ndeep reasons that once you see them, you will indeed be satisfied. \\nI will personally guarantee that one.  As Jesus put it, \"You will never\\nbe thirsty again.  Your cup will even flow over.\"\\n\\n\\nFrom King Solomon (970 B.C. to 930 B.C.):\\n\\n    \"It is the glory of God to conceal a matter;\\n     to search out a matter is the glory of kings.\"\\n\\n\\nJesus says in John 6:44 & 55:\\n\\n   \"No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him.\"\\n\\n\\nAnd in John 3:16:\\n\\n   \"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son,\\n   that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal\\n   life.\"\\n\\n\\nYou are included in \"whosoever\".  And I also pray that the Father is\\ndrawing you, which it seems He is doing else you wouldn\\'t be posting\\nto talk.religion.misc.  Remember Brian, you could be a St. Paul in the\\nmaking.  Paul not only mocked Christians as you do, but also had pleasure\\nstoning them.  Yet God showed him mercy, saved him, and Paul became\\non of the most celebrated men in the history of God\\'s church.\\n\\nYou see Brian, I myself better be careful and not judge you, because\\nyou could indeed be the next Paul.  For with the fervor that you attack\\nChristians,  one day you might find yourself one, and like Paul,\\nproclaim the good news of Jesus with that very same fervor or more.\\n\\nOr you could be the next Peter.  What Jesus said to Peter, Jesus would \\nprobably say to you: \"Satan would surely like to have you.\"  Why so?\\nBecause Peter was hard-headed, cynical and demonstrated great\\nmoments of stupidity, but once Peter committed himself to a task\\nhe did with full heart.  Peter was the only apostle to have the\\nfaith to walk on water as Jesus did.\\n\\nYou asked \"Why not believe in Zeus?\"  Zeus didn\\'t offer eternal life.\\nYou got nothing to gain by believing in Zeus.\\n\\n-------------------------------\\nBrian Ceccarelli\\nbrian@gamma1.lpl.arizona.edu\\n',\n",

I\\'m not\\nadvocating either position.  My concern is that people understand that\\nit\\'s possible to see these passages in different ways.  It\\'s possible\\nto see eternal destruction as just that -- destruction.  Rev often\\nuses the term \"second death\".  The most obvious understanding of that\\nwould seem to be final extinction.  The problem is that the NT speaks\\nboth of eternal punishment and of second death.  I.e. it uses terms\\nthat can be understood either way.  My concern here is not to convince\\nyou of one view or the other, but to help people understand that\\nthere\\'s a wide enough variety of images that it\\'s possible to\\nunderstand them either way.  As Tom Albrecht commented, the primary\\npoint is to do our best to keep people out of the eternal fire,\\nwhatever the details.  (To make things more interesting, Luke 20:35\\nimplies that the damned don\\'t get resurrected at all.  Presumably\\nthey just stay dead. -- yes I\\'m aware that it\\'s possible to \\nunderstand this passage in a non-literal way.)\\n\\n2 Peter 2:4-ff is talking about angels, and talks about holding them\\nin hell until the final judgement.  This isn\\'t eternal punishement.\\n\\nMatthew 25:31-46 talks about sending the cursed into eternal fire\\nprepared for the devil and his angels.  The fact that the fire is\\neternal doesn\\'t mean that people will last in its flames forever.\\nParticularly interesting is the comment about the fire having been\\nprepared for the devil and his angels.  Rev 20 and 21 talk about the\\neternal fire as well.  They say that the beast and the false prophet\\nwill be tormented forever in it.  When talking about people being\\nthrown into it (20:13-14), it is referred to as \"the second death\".\\nThis sounds more like extinction than eternal torment.  Is is possible\\nthat the fire has different effects on supernatural entities such as\\nthe devil, and humans?\\n\\n2 Thessalonians 1:6-10 similarly, what is \"everlasting destruction\"?\\nThis is not necessarily eternal torment.  This one can clearly be\\nunderstood either way, but I think it\\'s at least possible to think\\nthat everlasting is being used to contrast the kind of destruction\\nthat can occur in this life with the final destruction that occurs in\\neternity.\\n\\n2 Thessalonians 2:8 again talks about destruction.\\nRevelation 21:6-8: see comment above\\nRevelation 14:9-12 is probably the best of the quotes.  Even there,\\nit doesn\\'t explicitly say that the people suffer forever.  It says\\nthat the smoke (and presumably the fire) is eternal, and that \\nthere is no respite from it.  But it doesn\\'t say that the people\\nare tormented forever.\\n\\nPsalm 9:17:  I don\\'t see that it says anything relevant to this issue.\\n\\n--clh]\\n',\n",

Whereas, no one has proposed\\nFederal Agencies be denied F, and because they could recover it themselves,\\nThe correctness of the serial number can be tested by examining the pad bits\\nof N in E[N; F].\\n\\nThe one could selectively alter the law enforcement block as above, but the\\nmutilation could be detected.  A better approach would be to mutilate the\\nentire law enforcement block.  If it were done with a group encryption scheme\\nsuch as DES or (presumably) Skipjack, the chances the law enforcement block\\ncan be recovered are lessened.\\n\\nWhat do you want to bet the transmission protocol can be recognized and the\\nserial numbers decrypted in a target search?  When digital transmission\\nbecomes widely available, would there be a requirement that clipper protocol\\ntransmissions be refused when containing mutilated law enforcement blocks?\\n\\nOne way to avoid notice, would be to spoof protocol information of the block\\ncontaining M, as well as spoofing the law enforcement block.\\n\\nThe goal is to use a secure communications scheme, without redress to \\ndetection or key K interception (contained encrypted within the law\\nenforcement block).  The data stream is returned to its original state\\nfor use by the clipper chip (or system) if required, for proper operation.\\n\\nIt is somewhat improbable that the entire protocol will be contained within\\nthe clipper chip, yet likely that sequence of events will be tested for,\\nrequiring a valid law enforcement block to be received before accepting\\nand decrypting E(M; K);\\n\\nThe spoof chip could be implemented anywhere in the protocols, including\\non the resulting serial data stream.  Existing clipper products could\\nbe subborned.  After all, they are high security encryption systems right?\\n\\nSuper encipherment/encryption could allow the chip to be used without\\nredress to detection of the use of the chip, or disclosure of the serial\\nnumber.  Security must be adequate to deny the serial number, which should\\nnot be recoverable by other means.  One can see the use of cut outs for\\nprocurring clipper phones, or once the number of units is high enough,\\nstealing them.  It would be a mistake on the part of authority, but nice\\nfrom a point of privacy, if the serial number N were not associated with\\na particular clipper chip or lot of chips through the manufacturing and \\ndistribution process.  Hopefully the list of known missing or stolen\\nclipper serial numbers N encrypted with F, and the protocols are not \\nsufficient plaintext to attact the super encrypted clipper stream.\\nThis could be further made difficult by altering the temporal and or\\nspatial relationship of the clipper stream to that of the super encrypted\\nstream.\\n\\nDetection of an encrypted stream could tip off the use of the aforementioned\\nscheme.\\n\\n******************************************************************************\\n\\nIf you could capture valid law enforcement blocks not your own, and use\\nthem in a codebook sustitution with your own, where they point to a valid\\nlaw enforcement block stored in a library utilizing a session key matching\\nthe remainder of the transmission, you could simply out and out lie, yet\\ndeliver to monitoring and/or hostile forces a seemingly valid law enforcement\\nblock.   These captured law enforcement blocks would be used as authenticators,\\nsuch as in a manually keyed encryption system.  Fending this off would require\\nescalation in examining the protocols and blocks in the transmission.\\n\\nThe M code stream  might be independently attacked based on knowledge of\\nclipper chip protocols as revealed plaintext.  This could be invalidated\\nby changing the temporal and or spatial relationship of the clipper M stream\\nand the actual transmitted stream, under the control of a secure key\\ngenerator synchronized between endpoints.\\n\\nThe useful life time of captured law enforcement blocks might be limited\\nbased on hostile forces using them as targets following transmission\\ninterception.  You would need a large number of them, but, hey there's\\nsupposed to be millions of these things, right?  Adding time stamps to\\nthe encrypted law enforcement block is probably impractical, who wants\\nan encryption chip with a real time clock?\\n\\n*****************************************************************************\\n\\nThe entire idea of the law enforcement block can be invalidated.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

Second, the historical\\nrecord suggests that the positions attributed to Nestorius were not as\\nextreme as his (successful) opponents (who wrote the conventional history)\\nclaimed.  Mainly Nestorius opposed the term Theotokos for Mary, arguing\\n(I think correctly) that a human could not be called Mother of God.  I mean,\\nin the Athanasian Creed we talk about the Son \"uncreate\" -- surely even \\nArians would concede that Jesus existed long before Mary.  Anyway, Nestorius\\'s\\nopponents claimed that by saying Mary was not Theotokos, that he claimed\\nthat she only gave birth to the human nature of Jesus, which would require\\ntwo seperate and distinct natures.  The argument fails though, because\\nMary simply gave birth to Jesus, who preexisted her either divinely,\\nif you accept \"Nestorianism\" as commonly defined, or both natures intertwined,\\na la Chalcedon.\\n\\nSecond, I am not sure that \"Nestorianism\" is not a better alternative than\\nthe orthodox view.  After all, I find it hard to believe that pre-Incarnation\\nthat Jesus\\'s human nature was in heaven; likewise post-Ascension.  I think\\nrather that God came to earth and took our nature upon him.  It was a seperate\\nnature, capable of being tempted as in Gethsemane (since I believe the divine\\nnature could never be tempted) but in its moments of weakness the divine nature\\nprevailed.\\n\\nComments on the above warmly appreciated.\\n\\nJason Albert\\n\\n[There may be differences in what we mean by \"subject to sin\".  The\\noriginal complaint was from someone who didn\\'t see how we could call\\nJesus fully human, because he didn\\'t sin.  I completely agree that\\nJesus was subject to temptation.  I simply object to the idea that by\\nnot succumbing, he is thereby not fully human.  I believe that you do\\nnot have to sin in order to be human.\\n\\nI again apologize for confusing Nestorianism and monophysitism.  I\\nagree with you, and have said elsewhere, that there\\'s reason to think\\nthat not everyone who is associated with heretical positions was in\\nfact heretical.  There are scholars who maintain that Nestorius was\\nnot Nestorian.  I have to confess that the first time I read some of\\nthe correspondence between Nestorius and his opponents, I thought he\\ngot the better of them.\\n\\nHowever, most scholars do believe that the work that eventually led to\\nChalcedon was an advance, and that Nestorius was at the very least\\n\"rash and dogmatic\" (as the editor of \"The Christological Controversy\"\\nrefers to him) in rejecting all approaches other than his own.  As\\nregular Usenet readers know, narrowness can be just as much an\\nimpediment as being wrong.  Furthermore, he did say some things that I\\nthink are problematical.  He responds to a rather mild letter from\\nCyril with a flame worthy of Usenet.  In it he says \"To attribute also\\nto [the Logos], in the name of [the incarnation] the characteristics\\nof the flesh that has been conjoined with him ... is, my brother,\\neither the work of a mind which truly errs in the fashion of the\\nGreeks or that of a mind diseased with the insane heresy of Arius and\\nApollinaris and the others.  Those who are thus carried away with the\\nidea of this association are bound, because of it, to make the divine\\nLogos have a part in being fed with milk and participate to some\\ndegree in growh and stand in need of angelic assistance because of his\\nfearfulness ...  These things are taken falsely when they are put off\\non the deity and they become the occasion of just condemnation for us\\nwho perpetrate the falsehood.\"\\n\\nIt\\'s all well and good to maintain a proper distinction between\\nhumanity and divinity.  But the whole concept of incarnation is based\\non exactly the idea that the divine Logos does in fact have \"to some\\ndegree\" a part in being born, growing up, and dying.  Of course it\\nmust be understood that there\\'s a certain indirectness in the Logos\\'\\nparticipation in these things.  But there must be some sort of\\nidentification between the divine and human, or we don\\'t have an\\nincarnation at all.  Nestorius seemed to think in black and white\\nterms, and missed the sorts of nuances one needs to deal with this\\narea.\\n\\nYou say \"I find it hard to believe that pre-Incarnation that Jesus\\'s\\nhuman nature was in heaven.\"  I don\\'t think that\\'s required by\\northodox doctrine.

The average nuclear plant is 1000 MWe.  2) many\\nfossil plants were grandfathered when water discharge regulations were\\nadopted (\"why those old dirt burners can\\'t harm anything, let \\'em go.\").  \\n3) powered draft cooling towers, low enough to the ground to be generally\\nnot visible from off-site, are quite popular with fossil plants.  4) fossil\\nplants used to get much less regulatory attention than nuclears.\\n\\n>       Actually, fossil fuel plants run hotter than the usual \\n>boiling-water reactor nuclear plants.

Hence big cooling towers.  \\n\\n>       Oil and gas fired steam plants also have condensers, but they\\n>usually are sized to get the steam back into hot water, not most of the\\n>way down to ambient.  Some plants do cool the condensers with water,\\n>rather than air; as one Canadian official, asked about \"thermal \\n>pollution\" de-icing a river, said, \"Up here, we view heat as a resource\".  \\n\\nActually the condensing environment is essentially the same for plants\\nof similar size.  The issues are the same regardless of where the \\nheat comes from.  Condensers are run at as high a vacuum as possible in\\norder to reduce aerodynamic drag on the turbine.  The condenser pressure is\\nnormally water\\'s vapor pressure at the condensing temperature.  It is\\ndesirable that the steam exhaust be free of water droplets because \\nmoisture in the steam causes severe erosion damage to the turbine \\nlow pressure blades and because entrained water moving at high velocity\\ncauses erosion of the condenser tubes.  The coldest and thus lowest\\npressure condensing environment is always the best.  \\n\\nA related issue is that of pumping the condensate from the hotwell (where\\nthe water ends up after dripping off the condenser tubes.)  Since the\\ncondenser is at a very low pressure, the only force driving the \\ncondensate into the hotwell pumps is gravity.  If the condensate is too \\nhot or the gravity head is too low, the condensate will reflash into\\nsteam bubbles and cause the condensate pumps to cavitate.  This is a\\nparticularly destructive form of cavitation that is to be avoided at all\\ncosts.  \\n\\nThe hotwell pumps are located in the lowest point in the plant\\nin order to provide a gravity head to the pumps.  How much lower \\nthey must be is a function of how hot the water is allowed to get in\\nthe hotwell.  Typically hotwell temperatures run between 100 and 120 \\ndegrees depending on the temperature of the river water (this term is\\nused to describe the river grade water even when the cooling tower\\nsystem is operating in closed loop mode and essentially no river water\\nis pumped.)  When the river water temperature is high in the summer,\\noperators will typically allow the hotwell level to rise in order \\nto provide more gravity head.  There is a tradeoff involved since higher\\nhotwell levels will encroach onto the condensing tubes and reduce the\\ncondenser area.\\n\\nAt least in the East and elsewhere where moisture actually exists in the\\nair :-), the river water will almost always be cooler than the discharge\\nwater from the cooling towers.  The temperature of the discharge water\\nfrom the cooling towers is set by the ambient air temperature and\\nhumidity.  It is very rare in the East to hear of actual river water\\ntemperatures exceeding 70 degrees.  A vast difference from the typical\\n\"95-95\" days (95 degrees, 95% humidity) we see routinely in the East.\\nIt is not unusual, particularly where the econazis have been successful\\nin clamping rigid discharge water temperature limits on a plant, for the\\nplant to have to reduce the firing rate when the air temperature gets\\ntoo high and the condenser cannot handle the heat load without excessive\\npressure.\\n\\n>       Everybody runs closed-cycle boilers.

What\\'s up?\\n| \\n| This is a frequently asked question.  Every time it arises, it causes\\n| months of debate.  So let me see if I can answer you directly.\\n| Basically it\\'s because the Law was given to Moses as part of a\\n| specific covenanent with the Jews.  Most of us aren\\'t Jews, so we\\n| aren\\'t part of that covenant.  There was an argument early in\\n| Christian history about whether the Mosaic laws should apply to\\n| Gentiles who became Christians.  You can see the account of this\\n| debate in Acts 15.  The main question there was circumcision, but\\n| keeping the Sabbath would be part of it as well.  The apostles\\n| concluded that we need not become Jews in order to become Christians,\\n| and therefore that rules such as circumcision did not apply to us.\\n\\n1.  The law was known to man before it was revealed on Mount Sinai.  Rom\\n4:15 notes that \"where no law is, there is no transgression.\"  Not only\\ndid sin exist before Sinai (Eden), but the Sabbath was kept before it\\nwas revealed on Sinai (Ex 16).\\n\\n2.  The problem with the first covenant was not the law, but the promise\\nwhich undergirded it.  God wanted to perform his will in the lives of the\\npeople, but in their ignorance after 400 years of slavery, they promised\\n\"what ever He says to do we will do.\"  That is why the new covenant is\\nbased on \"better promises\" (Heb. 8:6).  Rather than do away with the law\\nGod promised to \"put my laws in their minds and write them on their\\nhearts\" (Heb. 8:10).\\n\\n3.  Including the Sabbath in the Acts 15 is selective inclusion.  The\\nSabbath was more important to the Jews than circumcision.  If any attempt\\nhad been made to do away with the Sabbath the reaction would have been\\neven more strident than is recorded in Acts 15.  Do not confuse the weekly\\nSabbath of the Decalogue with the ceremonial sabbaths which could occur at\\nany time of the week and were part of the law (ceremonial) which was\\n*added* because of transgression (of the moral law) (Gal 3:19).\\n\\n4.  Israel stands for God\\'s people of all time.  That is why God *grafted*\\nthe Gentiles in.  Roma 9:4 says that the adoption, the glory, the\\ncovenants, the giving of the law, the service of God and the promises\\nbelong to Israelites.   In explanation Paul makes it clear that being born\\ninto Israel is not enough \"For they are not all Israel, which are of\\nIsrael\" v 6.  Then in Gal 3:19 he says \"if ye be Christ\\'s, then are ye\\nAbraham\\'s seed, and heirs according to the promise.\"  All Christians are\\nAbraham\\'s seed, Jews, Israelites.  Not physically, for that is not the\\ncriterion, but spiritually.  We are joint heirs with Jesus based on the\\npromise God made to all his people the Israelites.\\n\\n| \\n| While Christians agree that the OT Laws do not all apply to us,\\n| because some of them are part of a specific covenanent with the Jews,\\n| we also expect to see some similarity between the things God expected\\n| from the Jews and the things he expects from us.  After all, it\\'s the\\n| same God.  However there are several ways of dealing with this.\\n| \\n| These days the most common approach is to separate the OT commandments\\n| into \"moral\" and \"ceremonial\".  Ceremonial commandments apply only to\\n| the Jews.  They are part of the specific Mosaic covenant.  These are\\n| thinsg like the kosher laws and circumcision.  Moral laws apply to\\n| everyone.  Most of the 10 commands are part of the moral law, except\\n| for the commandment about the Sabbath.  I believe most people who take\\n| this approach would say that the specific requirement to worship on\\n| the Sabbath is part of the ceremonial law, but a general obligation to\\n| worship regularly is part of the general moral law.  Thus Christians\\n| are free to choose the specific time we worship.\\n\\nPeople would probably agree but they are wrong.  How can the Sabbath\\ncommandment be ceremonial when it is part of a law which predates the\\nceremonial laws?  You are not free to choose your time of worship.  Even\\nif you were why do you follow a day of worship which has its origins in pagan\\nsun worship.  Would you rather give up a day which God blessed,\\nsanctified, and hallowed in exchange for one which all church leaders\\nagree has not biblical foundation (see Sabbath Admissions in\\nsoc.religion.christian.bible-study).\\n| \\n| A more radical approach (which is generally connected with John Calvin\\n| and the Reformed tradition) says that the Law as a whole is no longer\\n| binding.  Instead, we are entirely under grace, and our behavior\\n| should be guided solely by love.  Portions of the OT Law are still\\n| useful as guidance.  But they are not properly speaking legally\\n| binding on us.  In practice most people who take this position do not\\n| believe it is safe to leave Christians without moral guidannce.  While\\n| we may no longer be under Law, as sinners, it\\'s not safe for us to go\\n| into situations with no principles to guide us.  We\\'re too good at\\n| self-justification for that to be safe.  Thus Christians do have moral\\n| guidance, from things like Jesus\\' teachings, Paul\\'s advice, etc.\\n| These may not be precisely a Law, but they serve much the same\\n| function as, and have largely the same content as, the \"moral law\" in\\n| the previous analysis.  While Calvin would deny that we have a fixed\\n| legal responsibility to worship on any specific day, he would say that\\n| given human weakness, the discipline of regular worship is important.\\n| \\nI do not care what Calvin or any theologian says.  My guide is what God\\nsays.  If being not under the law means we do not have to keep the law,\\nwhy is it that the only section of the law we have trouble with is the\\nSabbath commandment, which is the only one God thought was important\\nenough to say *REMEMBER*?  If you study the word deeply you will note that\\nthe message is that we are no longer under the condemnation of the law but\\nfreed by the grace of God.  If a cop pulls me over for speeding, then in\\ncourt I ask for mercy and the judge does not throw the book at me but gives me\\ngrace, do I walk out of the court saying \"I can now go on speeding, for I\\nam now under grace?\"  Being under grace I now drive within the speed\\nlimit.  Paul adds to it in Rom. 3:31 \"Di we then make void the law through\\nfaith?  God forbid: yea, we establish the law.\"  \"Wherefore the law is\\nholy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good\" (Rom. 7:12).\\n\\n| In both analyses, the specific day is not an issue.  As a matter of\\n| tradition, we worship on Sunday as a memorial of Christ\\'s\\n| resurrection.  There\\'s some debate about what Acts shows about early\\n| Christian worship.  The most common analysis is that is shows Jewish\\n| Christians continuing to go to Jewish services on the Sabbath, but\\n| that specifically Christian service were not necessarily held then.\\n| Act 20:7 shows worship on the first day (Sunday), and I Cor 16:2 also\\n| implies gatherings on that day.\\n| \\n| There are a few groups that continue to believe Christians have to\\n| worship on the Sabbath (Saturday).  The best-known are the Seventh-Day\\n| Adventists and Jehovah\\'s Witnesses.  They argue that Act 20:7 is not a\\n| regular worship service, but a special meeting to see Paul off, and\\n| that I Cor 16:2 doesn\\'t explicitly say it\\'s a regular worship service.\\n\\nDo you prefer implication to fact?  A careful study of the Acts 20 shows\\nthat the meeting was on Saturday night and that on Sunday morning Paul did\\nnot go to a worship service, but set off on a long journey by foot to\\nAssos.  In ICor 16 there is no way you can equate \"lay by him in store\"\\nwith \"go to a worship service.\"\\n| \\n| It\\'s clear that this issue was a contested one in Paul\\'s time.  See\\n| Rom 14:5.  Paul\\'s advice is that we should be very careful about\\n| judging each other on issues like this.  One person sees a specific\\n| day as mandated by God, while another does not.  He who observes that\\n| specific day does it in honor of the Lord.  He who believes his\\n| worship is free of such restrictions also does it in honor of the\\n| Lord.  (Those who believe that the Sabbath is still mandated argue\\n| that Paul is not referring to Sabbath worship here.  Note however Col\\n| 2:16, which says something similar but briefer.  It explicitly\\n| mentions Sabbath.)\\n\\nWrong.  These are the sabbath days of the ceremonial law, not the Sabbath\\nday of the moral law.\\n| \\n| There are some differences among Christians about use of the word\\n| \"Sabbath\".  Originally the term referred to the 7th Day, the Jewish\\n| day of worship.  Many Christians now use it to refer to Sunday, the\\n| day of Christian worship.  They do this largely so that they can apply\\n| the 4th (or whatever -- there are a couple of different numbering\\n| schemes) commandment to it.  Reformed tradition does not do this.  It\\n| distinguishes between the Sabbath -- which is the observance mandated\\n| for Jews, and the Lord\\'s Day -- which is the free Christian worship.\\n| (The only reference I can find to this in the NT is Rev 1:10.)  There\\n| are also differences about laws regarding this day.  Many Christians\\n| support \"blue laws\", both in secular law and church law, setting aside\\n| that day and causing people to spend it in worship.  The more radical\\n| anti-legal approach sees such regulations as a return to the Jewish\\n| Sabbath, which is not appropriate to the free Christian worship of the\\n| Lord\\'s Day.\\n| \\nWhy would you prefer to twist and turn, relying on different arguments\\nwhich conflict with each other, rather than obey a simple request from a\\nGod who loved you enough to die for you.  Jesus died because the law could\\nnot be changed.  Why bother to die in order to meet the demands of a\\nbroken law if all you need to do is change the law.  Penalties for law\\nbreaking means the law is immutable.  That is why it is no sin not to\\nfollow the demands of the ceremonial laws.  It will always be a sin to\\nmake false gods, to violate God\\'s name, to break the Sabbath, to steal, to\\nkill, etc.  Except it you disagree.  But then your opinion has no weight\\nwhen placed next to the word of God.\\n\\nDarius\\n\\n[It\\'s not clear how much more needs to be said other than the FAQ.  I\\nthink Paul\\'s comments on esteeming one day over another (Rom 14) is\\nprobably all that needs to be said.  I accept that Darius is doing\\nwhat he does in honor of the Lord.  I just wish he might equally\\naccept that those who \"esteem all days alike\" are similarly doing\\ntheir best to honor the Lord.\\n\\nHowever I\\'d like to be clear that I do not think there\\'s unambiguous\\nproof that regular Christian worship was on the first day.  As I\\nindicated, there are responses on both of the passages cited.\\n\\nThe difficulty with both of these passages is that they are actually\\nabout something else.  They both look like they are talking about\\nnnregular Christian meetings, but neither explicitly says \"and they\\ngathered every Sunday for worship\".  We get various pieces of\\ninformation, but nothing aimed at answering this question.  \\n\\nAct 2:26 describes Christians as participating both in Jewish temple\\nworship and in Christian communion services in homes.  Obviously the\\ntemple worship is on the Sabbath.  Acts 13:44 is an example of\\nChristians participating in them.  Unfortunately it doesn\\'t tell us\\nwhat day Christians met in their houses.  Acts 20:7, despite Darius\\'\\nconfusion, is described by Acts as occuring on Sunday.  (I see no\\nreason to impose modern definitions of when days start, when the\\nBiblical text is clear about what was meant.)  The wording implies to\\nme that this was a normal meeting.  It doesn\\'t say they gathered to\\nsee Paul off, but that when they were gathered for breaking bread,\\nPaul talked about his upcoming travel.  But that\\'s just not explicit\\nenough to be really convincing.  Similarly with 1 Cor 16:2.  It says\\nthat on the first day they should set aside money for Paul\\'s\\ncollection.  Now if you want to believe that they gathered specially\\nto do this, or that they did it in their homes, I can\\'t disprove it,\\nbut the obvious time for a congregation to take an offering would be\\nwhen they normally gather for worship, and if they were expected to do\\nit in their homes there would be no reason to mention a specific day.\\nSo I think the most obvious reading of this is that \"on the first day\\nof every week\" simply means every time they gather for worship.  \\n\\nI think the reason we have only implications and not clear statements\\nis that the NT authors assumed that their readers knew when Christian\\nworship was.\\n\\n--clh]\\n',\n",

For instance, some third-world countries with terrible\\nmalnutrition problems export all the soya they can produce -- so that it can\\nbe fed to cattle in the US, to make tender juicy steaks and burgers.  They\\nhave to do this to get money to pay the interest on the crippling bank loans\\nwe encouraged them to take out.

Hell, if they\\'re only interested in fetuses, they could save more\\nof those by fighting for human rights in China.\\n\\nAnd besides, Suzanne\\'s answer implies that non-Western countries lack this\\nethic against infanticide.

Through a one\\nline function call, application developers can access the\\nfull features of HyperHelp and cut down drastically on\\ntheir development time.  HyperHelp can use the same RTF,\\nproject, and bitmap files as the MS Windows Help facility.\\nThis allows a documentation department to maintain a single\\nset of help documents portable between MS Windows, Motif and\\nOpen Look.  HyperHelp can also be authored in FrameMaker. \\nAnd with HyperHelp 3.0 Bristol introduces its SGML compiler!\\n\\nNew features in HyperHelp 3.0 include secondary windows,a character\\nbased viewer, segmented bitmaps, SGML support, and an improved History\\nwindow.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t     Xprinter 2.0\\n\\t\\t\\t     ------------\\nXprinter 2.0 allows developers to add sophisticated\\nprinter support to their existing/new X based applications\\nvery easily.

Take a look at the source code for\\nour demo and see Xprinter in action.\\n\\nIf you are interested in adding PostScript and PCL5 support\\nto your application, Xprinter is the tool for you!

However, unlike the Calvinists and\\nJansenists, I hold that grace is resistable, otherwise you end up with\\nthe idiocy of denying the universal saving will of God (1 Timothy 2.4). \\nFor God must give enough grace to all to be saved.  But only the elect,\\nwho he foreknew, are predestined and receive the grace of final\\nperserverance, which guarantees heaven.

Security Council Resolution 713 of \\n  September 25, 1991, the United Nations has been actively \\n  addressing the crisis in the former Yugoslavia.  The Security \\n  Council acted in Resolution 781 to establish a ban on all \\n  unauthorized military flights over Bosnia-Herzegovina.  There \\n  have, however, been blatant violations of the ban, and villages \\n  in Bosnia have been bombed.\\n  \\n  In response to these violations, the Security Council decided, \\n  in Resolution 816 of March 31, 1993, to extend the ban to all \\n  unauthorized flights over Bosnia-Herzegovina and to authorize \\n  Member States, acting nationally or through regional organi-\\n  zations, to take all necessary measures to ensure compliance.  \\n  NATO's North Atlantic Council (NAC) agreed to provide NATO air \\n  enforcement for the no-fly zone.  The U.N. Secretary General \\n  was notified of NATO's decision to proceed with Operation DENY \\n  FLIGHT, and an activation order was delivered to participating \\n  allies.\\n  \\n  The United States actively supported these decisions.  At my \\n  direction, the Joint Chiefs of Staff sent an execute order to \\n  all U.S. forces participating in the NATO force, for the conduct \\n  of phased air operations to prevent flights not authorized by \\n  the United Nations over Bosnia-Herzegovina.  The U.S. forces \\n  initially assigned to this operation consist of 13 F-15 and \\n  12 F-18A fighter aircraft and supporting tanker aircraft.  \\n  These aircraft commenced enforcement operations at 8:00 a.m. \\n  e.d.t. on April 12, 1993.  The fighter aircraft are equipped for \\n  combat to accomplish their mission and for self-defense.\\n  \\n  NATO has positioned forces and has established combat air \\n  patrol (CAP) stations within the control of Airborne Early \\n  Warning (AEW) aircraft.  The U.S. CAP aircraft will normally \\n  operate from bases in Italy and from an aircraft carrier in the \\n  Adriatic Sea.  Unauthorized aircraft entering or approaching \\n  the no-fly zone will be identified, interrogated, intercepted, \\n  escorted/monitored, and turned away (in that order).  If these \\n  steps do not result in compliance with the no-fly zone, such \\n  aircraft may be engaged on the basis of proper authorization by \\n  NATO military authorities and in accordance with the approved \\n  \\n                                more\\n  \\n       \\t    \\t      \\t   \\t     \\t       \\t    (OVER)\\n\\x0c\\n                                  2\\n  \\n  rules of engagement, although we do not expect such action will \\n  be necessary.  The Commander of UNPROFOR (the United Nations \\n  Protection Force currently operating in Bosnia-Herzegovina) was \\n  consulted to ensure that his concerns for his force were fully \\n  considered before the rules of engagement were approved.\\n  \\n  It is not possible to predict at this time how long such \\n  operations will be necessary.  I have directed U.S. armed forces \\n  to participate in these operations pursuant to my constitutional \\n  authority as Commander in Chief.  I am grateful for the con-\\n  tinuing support that the Congress has given to this effort, and \\n  I look forward to continued cooperation as we move forward \\n  toward attainment of our goals in this region.\\n  \\n       \\t    \\t      \\t   \\tSincerely,\\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n       \\t    \\t      \\t   \\tWILLIAM J.

The Administration is \\nannouncing a number of steps today in order to underscore its \\ndeep commitment to a new and closer partnership with Russia based \\non its government's commitment to reform.\\n\\n\\nExecutive Review of Cold War Laws\\n\\nPresident Clinton and President Yeltsin discussed the \\ndesirability of reviewing and updating U.S. laws and regulations \\nto reflect the end of the Cold War.  Congress has already acted \\nto revise many laws to reflect the fact that a communist Soviet \\nUnion has been replaced by a democratic Russia and other \\nindependent states.  However, many laws and regulations remain \\nthat contain language and restrictions that fail to reflect the \\nend of the Cold War and that unnecessarily undermine relations \\nwith Russia and the other new independent states.\\n\\nThe President today has ordered an Executive review of laws and \\nregulations so that, where appropriate and consistent with U.S. \\nsecurity and other national interests, such provisions can be \\nrevised or removed.  He has asked Ambassador-at-large Strobe \\nTalbott to coordinate this review on an expedited basis.  The \\nPresident has indicated that he will welcome congressional \\nefforts to help this review proceed as quickly as possible.\\n\\nThis review will weigh all considerations that pertain to \\nrevision of such provisions, and the initiation of the review may \\nhelp to remedy some of the circumstances that have justified such \\nprovisions in the past.  For example, because the Russians are \\neager to have their status changed under the Jackson-Vanik \\nlegislation, President Yeltsin personally assured President \\nClinton in Vancouver that he would look into individual cases \\ninvolving continuing restrictions on emigration from Russia.  By \\naddressing such issues, this review can help strengthen the bonds \\nof trust and partnership between the U.S. and Russia, and between\\nthe U.S. and the other new independent states.\\n\\n\\nReview of COCOM\\n\\nIt is also time to consider expeditiously with America's allies \\nthe future of another Cold War institution -- the Coordinating \\nCommittee for Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM).  The United \\nStates has begun a thorough review of how to reorient export \\ncontrols to the post-Cold War world, in which Russia is no longer \\nviewed as a potential adversary, but as a potential ally in \\ncombatting the proliferation of sensitive technology.\\n\\nSteps to Improve the Security Relationship\\n\\nThe President also has taken steps to move ahead on a range of \\nefforts discussed in Vancouver that can strengthen U.S. security \\nand improve our security relationship with the Russians and the \\nother states.\\n\\n\\nAccelerated Deactivation of Nuclear Weapons\\n\\nIn Vancouver, the two Presidents discussed accelerating the \\nprocess of deactivating nuclear strategic systems scheduled for \\nelimination under the START I Treaty.  President Clinton has \\ndirected the Department of Defense to complete this process well \\nin advance of the seven year reduction period outlined in START \\nI.  In addition, the United States, together with Russia and the \\nother relevant states of the former Soviet Union, will be \\nexploring programs under Nunn-Lugar to help them to accelerate \\nthis process.\\n\\n\\nMultilateral Test Ban\\n\\nThe two Presidents agreed at Vancouver that negotiations on a \\nmultilateral nuclear test ban should commence at an early date, \\nand that the two governments would consult with each other \\naccordingly.  The United States looks forward to beginning \\nconsultations with Russia, our allies, and other states, on the \\nspecific issues related to this negotiation.  The United States \\nexpects to start this consultative process within the next two \\nmonths.    \\n\\n\\nDetargeting\\n\\nThe two Presidents also began a dialogue on the issue of nuclear \\ntargeting at Vancouver.  As the United States and Russia move \\ninto a new relationship of strategic partnership, there is a need \\nto reexamine many of the assumptions and means employed in the \\npast to safeguard U.S. security against a nuclear adversary.  The \\nAdministration is beginning a comprehensive review of measures \\nthat could enhance strategic stability, including recent \\nproposals for detargeting nuclear missiles.   \\n\\nOther Measures to Create a New Security Relationship\\n\\nIn response to the incident involving a collision between US and \\nRussian submarines last month, Secretary Aspin will be ready to \\ndiscuss ways to avoid such incidents in the future with Russian \\nDefense Minister Grachev during his visit to the United States in \\nlate May.\\n\\nSecretary Aspin will also be prepared to move forward with \\nDefense Minister Grachev in May to develop a combined training \\nprogram between our two military forces and to prepare for joint \\nexercises in peacekeeping, such as that authorized by the UN \\nSecurity Council.  The United States looks forward to broadening \\nsuch training and exercises to include other peacekeeping \\ncontributors, in order to improve inter-operability, readiness, \\nand planning for multilateral peacekeeping operations.  The US \\nand Russia are working together to convene a May Ministerial \\nMeeting of the UN Security Council to discuss proposals for \\nenhancing the UN's peacekeeping capability and to move \\nconsideration of the Secretary-General's Agenda for Peace from \\nthe discussion to the implementation phase.  The U.S. is also \\nworking with the Russians to focus specifically on improvements \\nin the financing and management of UN operations.  The purpose of \\nthese initiatives will be to cooperate on peacekeeping for our \\nparticipation in UN or CSCE sponsored actions.\\n\\n\\nMultilateral and Bilateral Partnership with Reform\\n\\nFinally, the Administration continues to move ahead on a range of \\ninitiatives aimed at striking a partnership with economic and \\npolitical reformers throughout Russia and the other states.  The \\nAdministration is continuing work with our G-7 partners to \\nassemble the package of multilateral assistance that Secretaries \\nBentsen and Christopher recently negotiated in Tokyo.  And the \\nAdministration is continuing consultation with Congress over the \\nfurther efforts the U.S. will take to assist the process of \\nreform in Russia and the other states.\\n\\n                           *    *    *\\n\\nThe Administration believes these steps can increase American \\nsecurity while improving the relationship between the U.S. and \\nRussia, and between the U.S. and the other new independent \\nstates.\\n\\n                               -30-\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

But that doesn\\'t mean everything that comes out of\\nhis mouth is gold.  In fact (and here your lack of experience\\nshows), Pa\\'il is such a fanatic, embittered leftist that much of his\\nanti-Israel blathering (forget about anti-Irgun blathering) would be\\nconsidered something like treason in non-Israel contexts.  But of\\ncourse you don\\'t consider this AT ALL when you find a juicy\\n\"quotation\" that you can use to attack Israel.\\n\\nBenny Morris (of Hashomer Hatzair) represents himself as a \"scholar\"\\nwhen he rehashes the old attacks on the Irgun.  Don\\'t be fooled.\\nIt\\'s just the old Zionist ideological catfight, surfacing as an\\nattack on the (then-) Likud government.  If you will look closely at\\nthe section on Deir Yassin in his book on the War of Independence,\\nyou will see his \"indictment\" to be pure hot air.  And this is the\\nBEST HE CAN DO after decades of digging for any sort of damning\\nevidence.

It must sound spicy.  Even some Jews\\nlike to do it, for reasons of their own.\\n\\nPlease, don\\'t confuse any of you Deir Yassin \"massacre\" stuff\\nwith facts or scholarship.

While\\nthere is a profound reverence for the temple endowment, there is no\\ninjunction against discussing the ceremony itself in public.  But\\nsince public discussion is often irreverent, most Mormons would rather\\nkeep silent than have a cherished practice maligned.\\n\\nBut there are certain elements of the ceremony which participants\\nexplicitly covenant not to reveal except in conjunction with the\\nceremony itself.\\n\\n| Granted, the Gnostic \"Christians\"\\n| had their secret rituals, but these seem to have been taken entirely\\n| from pagan pre-Christian mystery religions.\\n\\nThere are other interpretations to Christian history in this matter.\\nOne must recall that most of what we know about the Gnostics was\\nwritten by their enemies.  Eusebius claims that Jesus imparted secret\\ninformation to Peter, James, and John after His resurrection, and that\\nthose apostles transmitted that information to the rest of the Twelve\\n(Eusebius, _Historia Ecclesiastica_ II 1:3-4).\\n\\nIrenaeus claims this information was passed on to the priests and\\nbishops (_Against Heresies_ IV 33:8), but Eusebius disagrees.  He\\nclaims the secret ceremonies of the Christian church perished with the\\napostles.  Interestingly enough, Eusebius refers to the groups which\\nwe today call Gnostics as promulgators of a false gnosis (Eusebius,\\nop. cit., III, 32:7-8).  His gripe was not that thay professed *a*\\ngnosis, but that they had the *wrong* one.\\n\\nWritings dealing with Jesus\\' post-resurrection teachings emphasize\\nsecrecy -- not so much a concealment as a policy of not teaching\\ncertain things indiscriminately.  In one story, Simon Magus opens a\\ndialog with Peter on the nature of God.  Peter\\'s response is \"You seem\\nto me not to know what a father and a God is: But I could tell you\\nboth whence souls are, and when and how they were made; but it is not\\npermitted to me now to disclose these things to you\" (_Clementine\\nRecognitions_ II, 60).  If any one theme underlies the _Recognitions_\\nit is the idea that certain doctrines are not to be idly taught, but\\ncan be had after a certain level of spiritual maturity is reached.\\n\\nNow one can approach this and other such evidence in many ways.  I\\ndon\\'t intend that everyone interpret Christian history as I do, but I\\nbelieve that evidence exists (favorably interpreted, of course) of\\nearly Christian rites analogous to those practiced by Mormons today.\\n\\n| Neither New Testament\\n| Christianity nor Biblical Judaism made a secret of their practices.\\n\\nBut if Judaism and Christianity had such ceremonies, would you expect\\nto read about them in public documents?  One can search the Book of\\nMormon and other Mormon scripture and find almost no information on\\ntemple worship.  Yes, you could establish that Mormons worship in\\ntemples, but you would probably be hard pressed to characterize that\\nworship.  On that basis, can we conclude that the Bible explains *all*\\npractices which might have taken place, and that absence of such\\ndescriptions proves they did not exist?\\n\\nMormon scholar Dr. Hugh Nibley offers us a list of scriptures from\\nwhich I have taken a few:\\n\\n1. \"It is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of\\nheaven, but to them it is not given\" (Matt. 13:11).\\n\\n2. \"All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given\"\\n(Matt. 19:11).\\n\\n3. \"I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them\\nnow\" (John 16:12).\\n\\n4. \"The time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs,\\nbut I shall shew you plainly of the Father\" (John 16:25).\\n\\n5. \"... unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter\"\\n(1 Cor. 3:1-2).\\n\\n6. \"Many things ... I would not write with paper and ink; but I ...\\ncome unto you and speak face to face\" (2 Jn. 1:12).\\n\\n(Nibley, _Since Cumorah_, pp. 92-94)\\n\\nAgain, these can also be interpreted many different ways.  I believe\\nthey serve to show that not all doctrines which could have been taught\\nwere actually taught openly.\\n\\n| I have heard that Joseph Smith took the entire\\n| practice (i.e. both the ritual and the secrecy surrounding the ritual)\\n| from the Freemasons.  Anybody in the know have any authoritative\\n| information on whether or not this claim is true?\\n\\nHistorically, Joseph Smith had been adiministering the temple\\nendowment ceremony for nearly a year before joining the Freemasons.\\nThere is diary evidence which supports a claim that the rite did not\\nchange after Smith became a Mason.  It can be argued that Smith had\\nample exposure to Masonic proceedings through the burlesque of his\\ntime and through his brother Hyrum (a Mason), though no specific\\nconnection has yet been established.\\n\\nMy conversations with Masons (with respect to temple rite\\ntranscriptions which have appeared on the net) have led me to believe\\nthat the connection from Masonry to Mormonism is fairly tenuous.  As\\nour moderator notes, most of what was similar was removed in the\\nrecent revisions to the temple ceremony.  I believe that critics who\\ncharge that Mormon rites were lifted from Freemasonry do not have\\nadequate knowledge of the rites in question.\\n-- \\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n         Jay Windley  *  University of Utah  *  Salt Lake City\\n                    jwindley@asylum.cs.utah.edu\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n',\n",

Windows Wordperfect works\\nefficiently unless you use the DOS drivers instead of Windows'.\\n\\nThe PCL4 dialect used in the Laserjet IIIP allows compression that\\npermits a full page 300 dpi image to be rendered with only one\\nmegabyte of memory.  An uncompressed image could be as large as\\nabout 909 Kbytes, but the printer needs about 300K of memory for\\nits internal house-keeping.  Laserjet IV models support banded\\nprinting that allows incrmental download of the image with\\ncompression in limited memory situations.  Deskjet downloadable\\nfonts are not compatible with laserjet fonts.\\n\\nA single page from a laserjet only requires about 20 seconds.  This\\nis faster than any but the most trivial printing from a deskjet\\nprinter.  The presumption, of course, being that the laser printer\\nhas completed its warm-up cyle.\\n\\nUntil ink chemistry is changed, wicking resulting in image\\ndeterioration is unavoidable.  I won't use the word impossible, but\\nmatching laser quality output from a deskjet printer is unlikely.\\nChosing an appropriate paper type helps, but does not eliminate the\\nproblem.\\n\\nLaser printers are more wastful of energy and consumable\\ncomponents.  HP does accept return of spent toner cartridges,\\nmitigating the material waste problem to a degree.  Energy waste\\ncould use more work.  Warm-up times have decreased, allowing\\nstand-by current consumption to be significantly reduced in the\\nlaserjet IV.\\n\\nKyocera produces a laser print engine that employs an amorphous\\nsilicon imaging drum with a replacable toner system.  The image\\ndrum is good for approximately 100K copies.  It is a very nice\\nprint engine.  I wish HP used the Kyocera engine.  Kyocera also has\\na neat modular paper source and stacker system.\\n\\nThe recommended duty cycle for a deskjet is significantly lower\\nthan any of HP's laser printers.  The pick-up pressure rollers are\\nsubject to wear and I case confirm eventually do wear out.  The\\nusual symptom is that the printer becomes reluctant to feed paper.\\nThe paper feed is integrated in a transport mechanism that is a\\nsingle part from HP service.  Replacement cost for the transport is\\nalmost $200.  The feed rollers are not separately replacable,\\nthough it would not be a difficult job for a competent technician.\\nI have disassembled and reassembled the transport on my own printer.\\n\\nIt depends upon the application which printer is best for you.  If\\nyou only print 5 or 10 pages a day and are satisfied with the\\nappearance of output, the deskjet is a very good choice.  As noted,\\nthe deskjet 500 is my choice for personal use.\\n\\n\\n-- \\nBill Mayhew      NEOUCOM Computer Services Department\\nRootstown, OH  44272-9995  USA    phone: 216-325-2511\\nwtm@uhura.neoucom.edu (140.220.1.1)    146.580: N8WED\\n\",\n",

What\\'s\\ngoing on? I will pass on psychologizing answers (whether dismissive or more\\nopen) as not the kind of issue to deal with here -- the question is what is\\nthe *theological* point involved?  And it has been quoted \"at\" me often\\nenough by those who don\\'t believe I take it seriously, that Jesus (is said\\nto have) said, \"If you love me, you will obey my commands.\"  [John 14:15]\\n\\nI am, like any Christian, the slave of Christ, and it is my will that I\\nshould do as He wills me to do.  I am (also, or instead) His younger brother,\\nbut still under His direction, though we both call God \"Abba.\"  Christians,\\ntherefore, will try to find what it is that their Lord commands them, and\\ndiscovering it will feel obligated to do it, or to confess their failure.\\nReaders here may set aside the theologizing jargon (such as \"slaves of\\nChrist\") -- the point is that adherents of a religion *will* read the texts\\n(whether classified as \"inspired\" or not) that are held up as models, in an\\neffort to find application to their own situations.  This practice ranges\\nfrom \"devotional\" reading of sermons and the like to the exegesis of canon-\\nical scripture as \"the Word of God.\"  And at the highest pitch, this leads\\nto a question of whether we *can* find in inspired scripture something that\\ncan act as \"absolute\" guidance for our actions.\\n\\nThe problem is in finding out just *what* it is our Lord commands.  I am\\ngoing to set aside for this essay one major direction in which Christians\\nhave looked for these commands, namely Christian tradition.  That is not\\nbecause *I* reject tradition, but because my primary audience in this essay\\nis Protestants, who deny tradition a determinative value, in favor of the\\nwitness of Scripture.  The question I want to deal with is, WHAT commandments\\ncan we find from our Lord in Scripture?  And that turns out to be a hard\\nquestion.  [ If any of my Protestant Inquisitors would *like* to turn the\\ndiscussion to the authority of tradition, I can accomodate them :-), unlike\\n*most* Protestants, Episcopalians admit claims from a) Scripture b) Reason\\nand c) Tradition on roughly equal standing. ]\\n\\nEarlier in John than my quote above, we read [John 13:34] \"I give you a new \\ncommandment: love one another.\"  This is the ONLY place in the NT where\\nChristians are given an explicit commandment, with the context commenting\\non its imperative mode pronouncement by Jesus.  At the same meal [so we\\n*readers* infer, since it is *not* in John, but in the Synoptics] Jesus\\nsays, \"Take this [bread]; this is my body.\"  [Mark 14:22, cf. Matthew 26:26,\\nLuke 22:19, 1 Corinthians 11:24]  The mode is imperative (Greek _labete_),\\nand hence this, too, is a \"commandment.\"\\n\\nIn *both* cases we have to *infer* that the command is directed to a wider\\ncircle than the immediate collocation of disciples -- because we judge the\\nevangelist\\'s point in mentioning it (with the disciples by then mostly or\\nentirely dead) is that *we* are expected to follow this as a commandment\\nfrom our Lord.  In the case of communion, Paul\\'s mention (at least; this\\nis probably true of the evangelists also) implies an ongoing ritual liturgy\\nin which these words operate to \"bind\" Christians to the original command\\nto his disciples, as a continuing commandment to the Christian community.\\n\\nI am entirely comfortable with this inference, but I *must* point out that\\nit is THERE, between us and the occasion on which Jesus spoke the command.\\nI take it as a clear inference, at the very least the EVANGELIST\\'S notion,\\nthat *all* Christians are called to love one another, in Jesus\\' command\\ndirected at the disciples.  But I have to call attention to the inference.\\nThe command CANNOT apply to me without the generalization from the specific\\ncontext of its statement to my own context as a \"disciple\" of Christ.\\n\\nAll reading of scripture has to make such inferences, to get any sense out\\nof the text whatsoever.  This is a general problem in reading these texts\\n-- we cannot read them at all without our *own* understanding of our native\\nlanguages in which we (normally) read the (translated) texts, and without\\n*some* appreciation of the original context (and at points, the original\\nlanguages, when English misleads us.) I am going to presume, in what follows,\\nthat we have the *general* problem of how to read scripture under control\\n[ I don\\'t *really* think this is true, but it will suffice for my current\\npurposes. ]  I will address ONLY the issues that arise when we have already\\ncoped with the understanding of a 2000 year old text from another world\\nthan the one we live in.  Questions at THAT level only introduce MORE reser-\\nvations about the commandments issue than will be found stipulating that we\\ncan read the texts as the original audience might have done.\\n\\nAmong the reasons we have for seeing John\\'s _agapate allelou_ as a *general*\\ncommandment (not merely an instruction by Jesus to this disciples on that\\none occasion), and one linking it to the Synoptic \"Great Commandment\" is\\nthat we have criticism, from Jesus, about limiting our love to those whom\\nwe congenially associate with.  In Matthew 5:43ff we read, \"You have learnt\\nhow it was said: \\'You must love your neighbor\\' and hate your enemy.  But I\\nsay to you: love your enemies.\"  In fact, the Leviticus context quoted\\ndoes NOT say \\'hate your enemy\\' -- it is merely the common human presumption.\\n(And Leviticus is at pains to say that the \"love\" should extend to strangers\\namongst the people of Israel.)  Luke, in expanding on this same Q context,\\ngoes on to have Jesus say. \"Even sinners love those who love them.\" [6:27]\\nAll of this suggests [quite strongly, I\\'d say :-)] that *limiting* the\\nscope of the \"new commandment\" is not quite what Jesus has in mind.  In\\nshort, inference *leads me* to generalizing the actual text to a command\\nthat is \"in force\" on Christians, and with objects not limited to other\\nChristians.\\n\\nTrickier than the _agapate allelou_ or Institution of communion, there is\\nthe case of the \"Great Commission\" where (Matthew 10, Mark 6) the Twelve\\nare sent out to evangelize, \"Proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is close\\nat hand.\"  The verb is imperative (_ke:russete_), but the context is rather\\nspecific to the Twelve, and there are further specifiers (as in \"Do not\\nturn your steps to pagan territory, and do not enter any Samaritan town\"\\n-- the Lukan parallels are even more specific to Jesus\\' final journey to\\nJerusalem) which make it harder to see this generalizing to all Christians\\nthan the previous examples.  That hasn\\'t prevented Christians from MAKING\\nsuch an inference; what I have to call attention to is that such inference\\nis NOT justified in the text, nor (unlike the first two cases I cite) by\\nthe rhetoric of the evangelist urged on the reader.  Still, Paul seems to\\nhave felt obliged to \"proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is close at hand\"\\neven (contrary to Jesus\\' instructions to the 12 :-)) to the gentiles, to\\nthe ends of the earth.  So, Christians after him have also taken this as\\na \"commandment\" in the sense of John 14:15.  Do I \"accept\" this?  I don\\'t\\nknow.  It is surely rather speculative.  But you see how the ripples of\\ninference spread out from the text that is the pretext -- Christians (may)\\ninfer a general commandment, applicable to all, from what is presented in\\nthe gospels as a specific occasion.  I do not (necessarily) object to this\\nkind of generalization -- but I *insist* that people who make it *must*\\nhave an understanding that they are *reasoning* (at some considerable\\nlength) from what we actually *have* in scripture.  There are *assumptions*\\ninvolved in this reasoning, and *these* are *not* themselves scriptural\\n(though people will do their best to \"justify\" their assumptions by OTHER\\nreferences to scripture -- which simply adds MORE inference into the mix!)\\n\\nLet\\'s move on to the \"Great Commandment\" -- that we should love God with\\nour whole hearts and minds and souls.  This is, perhaps, the Synoptic\\n\"equivalent\" of John\\'s _agapate allelou_.  And yet,  it is not PRESENTED\\nas a commandment, in our texts.  Rather, the context is controversy with\\nthe Pharisees.  To cite Matthew [22:34ff]\\n\\n\\t\"But when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees\\n\\tthey got together and, to disconcert him, one of them put a question,\\n\\t\"Master, which is the greatest commandment of the Law?\"\\n\\nIt is by no means obvious here (though I accept it as such) that Jesus\\'\\nanswer is meant to be a commandment *to Christians*.  He is answering a\\npolemic from his enemies.  [ Mark\\'s account, in  12:28-34 casts the answer\\nin a far more positive light as (so the \"scribe\" in this version says)\\n\"far more important than any holocaust (I need to point out that this word\\noriginates in the context of animal sacrifice; forget the Nazis for this)\\nor sacrifice.\"  Luke is intermediate -- he has a lawyer posing the question\\n\"to disconcert\" Jesus, and gets the Good Samarian parable for his pains\\n[ Luke 10:25-37 ].  The contexts here are so confusingly various that one\\ncould be forgiven for drawing *no* inferences :-)  In *no* account is this\\nsaid as if it were obviously to be taken as a commandment binding on\\nChristians -- though I think it an entirely reasonable conclusion in each\\ncase that Jesus thinks it to be so.  The point is that our mental gears\\nHAVE to grind a cycle or so to get to any conclusion from all of this about\\nwhat WE are commanded to do, by Jesus.  And all of this is contingent on\\nour understanding the point of Jesus\\' use of the Torah in the (all quite\\ndifferent) gospel accounts, and the application of such a context to *us*.\\n\\nThe different contexts among the Synoptics are curious.  It should be noted\\nthat ONLY in Luke do we get the \"fixing\" of this command by the parable of\\nthe Good Samaritan.  We may look for an analogous *intent* in Matthew, where\\n7:12 gives the \"Golden Rule\" as \"the meaning of the Law and the Prophets\"\\n(and where we may also hear an echo of Hillel saying the same, a generation\\nbefore Jesus.)  If we make these associations (which I think are entirely\\nreasonable), we are -- again -- indulging in inference.  The texts do not\\n*explicitly* support us; rather, we *read* the texts as having this kind of\\ninter-relationship.  Current literary theory calls this \"intertextuality.\"\\n\\nMy discussion of why the _agapate allelou_ \"has\" to apply beyond the \\ncommunity of the disciples, and beyound the circle of Christian believers,\\napplies again here, to buttress a conclusion that this *is* (despite the\\npresentation not saying so explicitly) a \"commandment\" to Christians.\\nFew Christians would disagree with my conclusions -- but I *must* point\\nout that they *are* conclusions, they *depend* on rather elaborate chains\\nof reasoning that are simply NOT present in the texts, themselves.\\n\\nThe contextual problem keeps coming up, more and more severely as we look at\\nthose sayings of Jesus that are NOT so universally taken by Christians as \\ncommandments.  And we get some really hard cases.  Take divorce.  Mark is \\npretty clear, \"The man who divorces his wife and marries another is guilty\\nof adultery against her.\"  [ 10:11, cf. Luke 16:18 ] -- except that Matthew\\nhas an escape clause [ \"except in the case of fornication\", 5:31 ]. This\\nseems to be a rather clear \"commandment\" (whether or not we take Matthew\\'s\\nreservation); and some Christians, to this day, take it so.  But some don\\'t,\\nat least in practice.  This is rather peculiar; it is not as if Jesus were\\nnot explicit about this (whereas He says nothing at all about some of the\\nthings people gnash their teeth over.)  How is it possible, if the commands\\nof Christ are clear, that Matthew can so disagree with the other evangelists\\nof the synoptic tradition?\\n\\nI\\'m going to continue this examination, into ever-murkier waters, but this\\nis enough to start with.  The theme is: \"finding commandments in scripture\\nis an exercise in inference; our inferences are informed by OUR assumptions,\\nthat is, our own cultural biases.\"  I have, so far, identified a very few\\n\"commandments\" that are generally accepted by all Christians -- and yet in\\nthese, already, some of the difficulties start to surface.  It is these\\ndifficulties I want to discuss in my next essay on this topic.  The divorce\\ncommandment already strikes at some of the difficulties: I see almost no\\nevidence that the people who are so eager to find commandments to condemn\\n*me* with, spend any time at all writing nasty screeds to soc.couples or\\nmisc.legal about the horrors or viciousness of divorce, or demanding that\\nUS law refuse to allow it, or refuse \"unrepentant divorcees\" places in\\ntheir churches.  [ That is not to say that divorce *doesn\\'t* enter into \\nconsideration in general -- it is most definitely a matter of concern, in\\neven the most \"liberal\" church circles.  For example, a (wildly) liberal\\nEpiscopalian priest of my aqauintence, in a (wildly) liberal diocese, has\\nrecommended to a couple who approached him to marry them that they have a\\n\"private\" secular ceremony before a judge, so that the \"public\" ceremony\\nhe celebrated need not go through an agonizing \"examination\" by officials\\nwho would just as soon NOT take on this role of interpreting the commands\\nwe are faced with as Christians.  This, in a church that was effectively\\nCREATED by a famous divorce! ]\\n-- \\nMichael L.

Having\\nstudied the Jeremiah/Ezekial period solidly for over a year at one\\nstage of my life, I have to say that there is a great deal of underlying\\ntheological meaning in the judgement prophesies. Let me make one point.\\nThe clash between Jeremiah and the \"false prophets\" was primarily in\\nthe theological realm. The \"false prophets\" understood their relatioship\\nto God to be based on the covenant that the Lord made with David. It is\\npossible to trace within the pages of the Old Testament who this covenant,\\nwhich was initially conditional on the continued obedience of David\\'s\\ndescendants, came to be viewed as an unconditional promise on the part\\nof the Lord to keep a descendant of David\\'s upon the throne and to never\\nallow Jerusalem to subjegated by any foreign power. Jeremiah was not a\\nJudahite prophet. He was from Anathoth, across the border in what had formerly\\nbeen Israelite territory. When he came to prophesy, he came from the\\ntheological background of the covenant the Lord had made with Israel\\nthrough Moses. The northern Kingdom had rejected the Davidic covenant\\nafter the death of Solomon. His theology clashed with the theology of the\\nlocal prophets. It was out of a very deep understanding of the Mosaic\\ncovenant and an actute awareness of international events that Jeremiah\\nspoke his prophesies. The \"judgement prophesies\" were deeply loaded with\\ntheological meaning.\\n\\nIn my opinion, both the Portland earthquake prophesy and the David Wilkerson\\n\"New York will burn\" prophesy are froth and bubble compared to the majestic\\ntheological depths of the Jeremiah prophesies.\\n\\n--\\n                                                                     ___\\nBill Rea                                                            (o o)\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------w--U--w---\\n| Bill Rea, Computer Services Centre, | E-Mail   b.rea@csc.canterbury.ac.nz |\\n| University of Canterbury,           | or     cctr114@csc.canterbury.ac.nz |\\n| Christchurch, New Zealand           | Phone (03)-642-331 Fax (03)-642-999 |\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n',\n",

              "  'From: ldo@waikato.ac.nz (Lawrence D\\'Oliveiro, Waikato University)\\nSubject: QuickTime performance (was Re: Rumours about 3DO ???)\\nOrganization: University of Waikato, Hamilton, New Zealand\\nLines: 67\\n\\nOK, with all the discussion about observed playback speeds with QuickTime,\\nthe effects of scaling and so on, I thought I\\'d do some more tests.\\n\\nFirst of all, I felt that my original speed test was perhaps less than\\nrealistic. The movie I had been using only had 18 frames in it (it was a\\nversion of the very first movie I created with the Compact Video compressor).\\nI decided something a little longer would give closer to real-world results\\n(for better or for worse).\\n\\nI pulled out a copy of \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" that I had recorded off TV\\na while back. About fifteen minutes into the movie, there\\'s a sequence where\\nthe Earth shuttle is approaching the space station. Specifically, I digitized\\na portion of about 30 seconds\\' duration, zooming in on the rotating space\\nstation. I figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between\\nframes. To increase the differences between frames, I digitized it at only\\n5 frames per second, to give a total of 171 frames.\\n\\nI captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384*288 pixels with the Spigot\\ncard in my Centris 650 (quarter-size resolution from a PAL source). I then\\nimported it into Premiere and put it through the Compact Video compressor,\\nkeeping the 5 fps frame rate. I created two versions of the movie: one scaled\\nto 320*240 resolution, the other at 160*120 resolution. I used the default\\n\"2.00\" quality setting in Premiere 2.0.1, and specified a key frame every ten\\nframes.\\n\\nI then ran the 320*240 movie through the same \"Raw Speed Test\" program I used\\nfor the results I\\'d been reporting earlier.\\n\\nResult: a playback rate of over 45 frames per second.\\n\\nThat\\'s right, I was getting a much higher result than with that first short\\ntest movie. Just for fun, I copied the 320*240 movie to my external hard\\ndisk (a Quantum LP105S), and ran it from there. This time the playback rate\\nwas only about 35 frames per second. Obviously the 230MB internal hard disk\\n(also a Quantum) is a significant contributor to the speed of playback.\\n\\nI modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional\\nscaling factors, and tried playing back the 160*120 movie scaled to 320*240\\nsize. This time the playback speed was over 60 fps. Clearly, the poster who\\nobserved poor performance on scaled playback was seeing QuickTime 1.0 in\\naction, not 1.5. I\\'d try my tests with QuickTime 1.0, but I don\\'t think it\\'s\\nentirely compatible with my Centris and System 7.1...\\n\\nUnscaled, the playback rate for the 160*120 movie was over 100 fps.\\n\\nThe other thing I tried was saving versions of the 320*240 movie with\\n\"preferred\" playback rates greater than 1.0, and seeing how well they played\\nfrom within MoviePlayer (ie with QuickTime\\'s normal synchronized playback).\\nA preferred rate of 9.0 (=> 45 fps) didn\\'t work too well: the playback was\\nvery jerky. Compare this with the raw speed test, which achieved 45 fps with\\nease. I can\\'t believe that QuickTime\\'s synchronization code would add this\\nmuch overhead: I think the slowdown was coming from the Mac system\\'s task\\nswitching.\\n\\nA preferred rate of 7.0 (=> 35 fps) seemed to work fine: I couldn\\'t see\\nany evidence of stutter. At 8.0 (=> 40 fps) I *think* I could see slight\\nstutter, but with four key frames every second, it was hard to tell.\\n\\nI guess I could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the\\nkey frames, to make the stutter more noticeable. Of course, this will also\\nimprove the compression slightly, which should speed up the playback performance\\neven more...\\n\\nLawrence D\\'Oliveiro                       fone: +64-7-856-2889\\nComputer Services Dept                     fax: +64-7-838-4066\\nUniversity of Waikato            electric mail: ldo@waikato.ac.nz\\nHamilton, New Zealand    37^ 47\\' 26\" S, 175^ 19\\' 7\" E, GMT+12:00\\n',\n",

Medical doctors have a very specific and specialized \"jargon\",\\nnecessary for precise communication within their field (which I\\'m fully\\ncognizant of since I, too, speak \"jargonese\" when with my peers).  For the\\nsituation in sci.med, many times the words or phrases used by doctors can\\nhave a different and more specific meaning than the same word used in the\\nworld at large, causing significant miscommunication.  One example word,\\nand very relevant to the yeast discussion, is the exact meaning of \"systemic\".\\nIt is now obvious to me that the meaning of this word is very specific, much\\nmore so than its meaning to a non-doctor.  There is also the observation of\\nthis newsgroup that both doctors and non-doctors come together on essentially\\nequal terms, which, when combined with the jargon issue, can further fan\\nthe flames.  This is probably the first time that practicing doctors get\\nreally \"beat up\" by non-doctors for their views on medicine, which they\\notherwise don\\'t see much of in their practice except for the occasional\\n\"difficult\" patient.\\n\\nPoint 2:\\n\\nI understand the viewpoint among many practicing doctors that they will not\\nprescribe any treatments/therapies for their patients unless such treatments\\nhave been shown to be effective and the risks understood from well-constructed\\nclinical trials (usually double-blind), or that such treatments/therapies are\\npart of an approved and funded clinical trial.  To these doctors, to do any\\ndifferently would, in this belief system, be unethical practice.  And it\\nfollows that any therapy not on the \"accepted\" list is therefore a non-\\ntherapy - it does not even exist, nor does the underlying hypothesis or\\ntheory have any validity, even if it sounds very plausible by extrapolation\\nof what is currently known.  Anecdotal evidence has no value, either, from\\na treatment point-of-view.\\n\\nAnd by and large, as a scientist myself, I am glad that medical practice/\\nscience takes such a rigorous approach to medical treatment.  However, as\\nalso being a human being (last I checked), and having been one of those people\\nthat has been significantly helped by a currently unaccepted treatment, where\\n\"standard\" medicine was not able to help me, has caused me to sit back and\\nwonder if holding such an extreme and rigid \"scientific\" viewpoint is in\\nitself unethical from humanitarian considerations.  After all, the underlying\\nintent of the \"scientific\" approach to medicine is to protect the health of\\nthe patient by providing the best possible care for the patient, so the\\npatient should come first when considering treatment.\\n\\nWhat we need is a slightly modified approach to treatment that satisfies both\\nthe \"scientific\" and the \"humanitarian\" viewpoints.  In an earlier post I\\noutlined a crazy idea for doing just that.  The gist of it was to give any\\nphysician freedom and encouragement by the medical community to prescribe\\nalternate, not yet proven therapies (maybe supported by anecdotal evidence)\\nfor patients who *all* avenues of accepted therapies have been exhausted\\n(and not until then).  The patient would be fully informed that such\\ntherapies/treatments are not supported by the proper clinical trials and that\\nthere are real potential risks with real possibilities of no benefit derived\\nfrom them.\\n\\nThis approach satisfies the need for scientific rigor.  It also satisfies\\nthe humanitarian needs of the patient.  And the reality is that many patients\\nwho have reached a dead-end in the treatment of their symptoms using accepted\\nmedicine *will* go outside the orthodox medical community:  either to the\\ndoctors who are brave enough to prescribe such treatments at the risk of losing\\ntheir license, or worse, to non-doctors who have not had the proper medical\\ntraining.  This approach also recognizes this reality and keeps the control\\nmore within orthodox medicine, with the benefits that the information gleaned\\ncould help focus limited resources towards future clinical trials in the most\\nproductive way.  Everybody wins in this admittedly rose-colored approach - I\\'m\\nsure there are real problems with this approach as well - it is presented\\nmore as a strawman to stimulate discussion.\\n\\nHopefully what I write here may give the sci.med doctors a better idea as to\\nwhy I am \"open\" to alternative therapies, as well as why I have real\\ndifficulty (read \"apparent hostility\") with the \"coldness\" of the 99.9% pure\\n\"scientific\" approach to medicine.  I believe the best approach to medical\\ntreatment is one where both the \"humanitarian\" aspects are balanced with and\\nby the \"scientific\" aspects.

The other day I was feeling a tad nostalgic and thought\\nabout constructing an old-time crytal radio set.  I figured on\\nsubstituting a modern germanium diode for the crystal, and winding the\\nantenna coil, etc., myself.\\n\\nThe only problem I seem to have is in locating a source for a tuning\\ncapacitor -- you know, the old meshed-plate variable condensers which\\nused to be the mainstay for tuning circuits.  Well these things seem to\\nbe all but extinct in their original catalog habitats.  Trimmer\\ncapacitors are relatively abundant, but are not really suitable for this\\napplication.\\n\\nSo, can anyone point me to a supplier of tuning capacitors in the \\n0--360 pF range?\\n\\nManythanks.\\n\\n-- \\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nGreg Neill,               | ounce (ouns), n. - The standard unit of\\nHNSX Supercomputers   Inc.|   prevention, equal to one pound of cure.\\ngneill@cid.aes.doe.ca     | \\n',\n",

I bought it in California, and if\\nit\\'ll let me, I\\'d like to keep it for another year.  The only problem is these\\nIndiana winters--my heater controls don\\'t work.\\n\\nThe car has vacuum operated control switches for the vents.  Right now it is\\nstuck in the \"vent\" mode.  It will blow warm air, but I can\\'t switch the air\\nflow to either the floor (I can live without this) or the defrost (I can\\'t \\nlive without this).  I probably could just jam the air deflector to the \\ndefrost position, but this blows a lot of air in my face and is, well,\\nkind of like putting a vacuum cleaner in reverse.\\n\\nI have taken parts of the dash off and looked at the vacuum system and I think\\nthe problem (or part of it) is with the two diaphragms which control up/down\\nand outside/inside air flow.  THe diaphragm which controls outside(vent)/in-\\nside(no vent) air is cracked most of the way around, and the other one is\\nprobably damaged too, considering the advanced age of the car.\\n\\nTwo questions:\\n\\n\\t1)  Is there anything I should be aware of about this (other than\\n\\tthe fact that I should move from Indiana) ?\\n\\n\\t2)  In the event that replacement diaphragms aren\\'t available, is there\\n\\ta way to \"fix\" this?\\n\\nTHanks for any advice/info\\n\\nselah,\\n\\nDan\\nlovall@physics.purdue.edu\\n',\n",

Watson Research\\n\\n(NOTE: The followups are set to comp.os.os2.misc.  DMQS files describe\\nmonitors and valid modes to be used by the XGA-2 under both Windows and\\nOS/2.)\\n\\nTHESE FILES ARE UNSUPPORTED!  IBM has nothing to do with these files or\\nthis post.  It\\'s personal this time (and every time I post -- see the\\nsignature).\\n\\nDue to demand and requests, here are some additional DMQS files I\\'ve\\ncollected for the XGA-2.  These files function with the latest revision\\nof the drivers for the XGA-2.  Not all these files will work under Windows\\nwith the drivers available to the general public at this time.  All files\\nwill function under the most recent OS/2 2.1 beta and those I\\'ve tried have\\nworked under OS/2 2.0+SP.  Not all files have been fully tested.\\n\\nTHESE FILES ARE UNSUPPORTED!  They represent a personal collection, not\\nanything resembling an officially supported set.\\n\\nAs a standard disclaimer I would like to point out the following facts:\\n1) Some of these files may run your adapter out of spec.  Doing so can\\n   stress the ICs on the card and may result in incorrect operation or in\\n   shorter life (how short depends on how much out of spec [boom!] :-).\\n2) Some of these files may run your adapter in a region that is out of\\n   spec for your monitor, resulting in damage to your monitor.\\n3) You should be knowledgable about your monitor and adapter\\'s ability\\n   to use the mode you select.  Using these files represents hacking\\n   in a very true sense, so practice safe computing and don\\'t play\\n   around too much if you don\\'t like the risks and aren\\'t knowledgable\\n   about what you\\'re doing.\\n4) If you feel uncomfortable with all the warnings, use the DMQS files\\n   you have or wait until IBM releases official, tested DMQS files.\\n   Although you should be aware of warning 2) even with the IBM files.\\n\\nTHESE FILES ARE UNSUPPORTED!  By using them you may invalidate your\\nwarrenty.  Not all have been fully tested -- I don\\'t have that many\\nmonitors.\\n\\nInstallation: unpack in your DMQSPATH environment variable, usually\\nc:\\\\xga$dmqs.  Then use the methods described in your XGA-2 installation\\ndiskette to change your adapter or settings.\\n\\nPacking: these files have been packed with the latest INFOZIP utility.  \\nYou will need PKZip 2.x if you don\\'t have the INFOZIP utilities.\\n\\nSubmitting:  feel free to send me uuencoded versions of your favorite DMQS\\nfiles for your favorite monitors.

Space Science\\nDept.) on this subject, specifically on a small-scale Solar Sail\\nproposed as a student space project. The guy giving the talk was keen to\\ngenerate interest in the project. I\\'ll typein the handout he gave out at\\nthe meeting. Here goes : \\n\\n\\t\\t\\tThe Microlight Solar Sail\\n\\t\\t\\t-------------------------\\n\\n1. Introduction\\nThe solar sail is a well-established concept. Harnessing the pressure of\\nsunlight, a spacecraft would have unlimited range. In principle, such a\\nvehicle could explore the whole Solar System with zero fuel consumption.\\n\\nHowever it is more difficult to design a practical solar sail than most\\npeople realize. The pressure of sunlight is only about one kilogram per\\nsquare kilometer. Deploying and controlling the large area of aluminized\\nfabric which would be necessary to transport a \\'conventional\\' type\\nspacecraft is a daunting task. This is why, despite the potential of hte\\nidea, no such craft has actually been launched to date.\\n\\n2.Design\\nRecent advances in microelectronics make possible a different concept: a\\ntiny sail just a few metres in diameter which could be controlled purely\\nbe electronics, with no mechanical parts. Several attitude control\\nmethods are feasible: for example the pressure sunlight exerts on a\\npanel of solar cells varies according to whether power is being drawn.\\n\\nThe key components of the craft will be a minute CCD camera developed at\\nEdinburgh University which can act as both attitude sensor and data\\ngathering device; solar cells providing ~1 watt power for control and\\ncommunication; and a directional radio antenna etched onto the surface\\nof the sail itself. Launched as a piggyback payload, the total cost of\\nthe mission can be limited to a few tens of thousands of dollars.\\n\\n3.Missions\\nThe craft would be capable of some ambitious missions. For example:\\na) It could rendezvous with a nearby asteroid from the Apollo or Amor\\ngroups. Closeup pictures could be transmitted back to Earth at a low bit\\nrate.\\nb) It could be steered into a lunar polar orbit. Previously unobserved\\nareas around the lunar poles could be viewed. By angling the sail to\\nreflect sunlight downwards, polar craters whose bases never receive\\nsunlight could be imaged. Bright reflections would confirm that\\nvolatiles such as water ice have become trapped in these\\nlocations.[Immensely valuable information for setting up a manned lunar\\nbase, BTW]\\nc) It could be sent to rendezvous with a small asteroid or comet\\nnucleus.

And enlightening.\\n\\nHere\\'s my analysis of Jose Canseco, circa Sep \\'92, and Jose Canseco,\\ncirca June 1986.\\n\\n1.  He\\'s bulked up too much.  Period.  He needs to LOSE about 20 pounds,\\n    not gain more bulk.\\n\\n2.  His bat speed has absolutely VANISHED.  Conservatively, I\\'d say he\\'s\\n    lost 4%-7% of his bat speed, and that\\'s a HUGE amount of speed.\\n\\n3.  That open stance is KILLING him.   Note that he acts sort of like\\n    Brian Downing - way open to start, then closes up as ball is\\n    released.  Downing could do this without significant head movement -\\n    Canseco can\\'t.  Also, note that Canseco doesn\\'t always close his\\n    stance the same way - sometimes, his hips are open, sometimes,\\n    they\\'re fully closed.  Without a good starting point, it\\'s hard\\n    to make adjustments in your swing.\\n\\nWhat would I do, if I were Jose?\\n\\nAside from salting away a large sum of a cash that I could never touch,\\nso that I\\'d never have to work again, I\\'d restructure my entire swing.\\n\\nFirst, minimize movement before the swing.  Close and widen the stance,\\nand severely cut down the stride I take on my swing.  Hopefully, this\\nwill cut down on the time I need to swing, and will allow me to move\\nthe bathead more freely.\\n\\nSecond, drop 20 pounds.  Cut out the weight work.\\n\\nThird, relax the wrists.  Will cost some power, but until I can find\\nmy 1988 stroke, concentrate on keeping the back shoulder up, rolling\\nthe wrists through the strike zone, and hit line drives.  His strength\\n is more than enough so that some of those line drives will get out of\\nthe park.\\n\\nIf Canseco\\'s open stance and resulting bad habits are a result of his back\\nproblems, he\\'ll be out of baseball in three years.  If not, he could\\nstill hit 600+ HR.\\n\\n\\n-- \\n*   Gary Huckabay   * \"You think that\\'s loud enough, a$$hole?\"           *\\n*   \"Movie Rights   * \"Well, if you\\'re having trouble hearing it, sir,   *\\n*   available thru  *  I\\'d be happy to turn it up for you.

Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and Technology\\nPolicy, outlined to the members-designate of the Advisory Committee on the\\nRedesign of the Space Station on April 3, three budget options as guidance\\nto the committee in their deliberations on the redesign of the space\\nstation.\\n\\n        A low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7 billion and a\\nhigh option of $9 billion will be considered by the committee.  Each\\noption would cover the total expenditures for space station from fiscal\\nyear 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for development,\\noperations, utilization, Shuttle integration, facilities, research\\noperations support, transition cost and also must include adequate program\\nreserves to insure program implementation within the available funds.\\n\\n        Over the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within the NASA\\nbudget for the President\\'s new technology investment.  As a result,\\nstation options above $7 billion must be accompanied by offsetting\\nreductions in the rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a space station\\noption of $9 billion would require $2 billion in offsets from the NASA\\nbudget over the next 5 years.\\n\\n        Gibbons presented the information at an organizational session of\\nthe advisory committee.  Generally, the members-designate focused upon\\nadministrative topics and used the session to get acquainted.  They also\\nreceived a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation on the process the\\nStation Redesign Team is following to develop options for the advisory\\ncommittee to consider.\\n\\n        Gibbons also announced that the United States and its\\ninternational partners -- the Europeans, Japanese and Canadians -- have\\ndecided, after consultation, to give \"full consideration\" to use of\\nRussian assets in the course of the space station redesign process.\\n\\n        To that end, the Russians will be asked to participate in the\\nredesign effort on an as-needed consulting basis, so that the redesign\\nteam can make use of their expertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR\\nand the possible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and systems.\\nThe U.S. and international partners hope to benefit from the expertise of\\nthe Russian participants in assessing Russian systems and technology.  The\\noverall goal of the redesign effort is to develop options for reducing\\nstation costs while preserving key research and exploration capabilitiaes.\\nCareful integration of Russian assets could be a key factor in achieving\\nthat goal.\\n\\n        Gibbons reiterated that, \"President Clinton is committed to the\\nredesigned space station and to making every effort to preserve the\\nscience, the technology and the jobs that the space station program\\nrepresents.  However, he also is committed to a space station that is well\\nmanaged and one that does not consume the national resources which should\\nbe used to invest in the future of this industry and this nation.\"\\n\\n        NASA Administrator Daniel S.  Goldin said the Russian\\nparticipation will be accomplished through the East-West Space Science\\nCenter at the University of Maryland under the leadership of Roald\\nSagdeev.\\n\\n------- End of Blind-Carbon-Copy\\n',\n",

If you don\\'t, then what we\\nhave is anecdotal and uncontrolled evidence on one side, and abject\\ndisbelief on the other.  In which case, please, there is no point in yelling\\nback and forth at each other any longer since neither side has any\\nconvincing evidence either positive or negative.  \\n\\nAnd I understand that your abject disbelief is based on the existence of\\npeople who may get famous or make money applying the diagnosis to everything\\nin sight, making wild claims with no evidence, and always refusing to do\\ncontrolled studies.  But that has absolutely no bearing on the apparently\\nsincere experiences of the people on the net observing anti-fungals working\\non themselves and other people in certain specific cases.  There are also\\nquacks who sell oral superoxide dismutase, in spite of the fact that it\\'s\\ncompletely broken down in the guts, but this doesn\\'t change the genuine\\nscientific knowledge about the role of superoxide dismutase in fighting\\noxidative damage.

If there\\'s some\\nother reason (besides the quacks), if only anecdotal, to think it could be\\ntrue, then that is what has to be considered, that is what the net people\\nhave been talking about.\\n\\nBut again, there is no point in arguing about it.  There is anecdotal\\nevidence, and there is no convincing evidence, and there are also some\\ncandida quacks out there, I hope everyone can agree on all of that.

As you know, there are 2 kinds of i18n implementation from MIT\\'s \\nX11R5 release -- Xsi and Ximp. Our original implementation of the toolkit\\nuses Xsi.\\n\\nOur toolkit manages each character\\'s size based on our own font management system.\\nIn order to do that, the \\'wchar_t\\' typed character strings must be decomposed\\nto character sets. This means that if one wchar_t type compound string with \\nASCII and Kanji mixed, for example, is given, each element of the wchar_t\\narray must be checked its corresponding character set based on a bit layout\\nand application environment\\'s locale. In this case if the locale is \\'japanese\\',\\neach wchar_t character will be classified either to iso8859-1, jisx0208 or so.\\n\\nWe need a function to do this. The function must check how many characters\\nfrom the top are the same character set and what the character set is.\\n\\nWe could not find any public X11R5 function to do that and inevitably, used\\nXsi\\'s internal functions to construct that function. The following is the\\nsource code of that function \\'decomposeCharacterSet()\\'.\\n\\n\\n//I18N.h\\n// This may look like C code, but it is really -*- C++ -*-\\n// $Id: I18N.h,v 1.1 1992/01/21 12:05:24 iima Exp iima $\\n\\n#ifndef _I18N_H\\n#define _I18N_H\\n\\n#include <X11/Xlib.h>\\n\\nextern int decomposeCharacterSet(const wchar_t *wc_str,\\t/* IN */\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t int wc_len,\\t\\t/* IN */\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t char *buf,\\t\\t/* OUT */\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t int *buflen,\\t\\t/* IN/OUT */\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t int *scanned_len,\\t/* OUT */\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t char **charset);\\t/* OUT */\\nextern XmString wcharToXmString(const wchar_t *wc_str);\\nextern XmStringCharSet charsetOfWchar(const wchar_t wc);\\n\\n#endif /* _I18N_H */\\n\\n//I18N.cc\\n/* $Id: I18N.cc,v 1.1 1992/01/21 12:05:05 iima Exp $ */\\n\\n#include <stdlib.h>\\n#include <X11/Xlibint.h>\\n#include <Xm/Xm.h>\\n#include \"I18N.h\"\\n\\nextern \"C\" {\\n#include <X11/wchar.h>\\n#define _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset XXX_XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset\\n#define _Xmbfscs XXX_Xmbfscs\\n#define _Xmbctidtocsid XXX_Xmbctidtocsid\\n#include \"Xlocaleint.h\"\\n#undef _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset\\n#undef _Xmbfscs\\n#undef _Xmbctidtocsid\\n    extern int _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset(XLocale, const wchar_t*, int,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t char*, int*, int*, int*);\\n    extern Charset *_Xmbfscs(XLocale, _CSID);\\n    extern _CSID _Xmbctidtocsid(XLocale, _CSID);\\n};\\n\\nint decomposeCharacterSet(const wchar_t *wc_str,/* IN */\\n\\t\\t\\t  int wc_len,\\t\\t/* IN */\\n\\t\\t\\t  char *buf,\\t\\t/* OUT */\\n\\t\\t\\t  int *buf_len,\\t\\t/* IN/OUT */\\n\\t\\t\\t  int *scanned_len,\\t/* OUT */\\n\\t\\t\\t  char **charset)\\t/* OUT */\\n{\\n    XLocale xlocale = _XFallBackConvert();\\n    int ctid;\\n    int status;\\n    Charset *xcharset;\\n    \\n    status = _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset(xlocale, wc_str, wc_len, buf,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t       buf_len, scanned_len, &ctid);\\n    if (status == Success) {\\n\\txcharset = _Xmbfscs(xlocale, _Xmbctidtocsid(xlocale, ctid));\\n\\t*charset = (xcharset) ? xcharset->cs_name : NULL;\\n    }\\n    else\\n\\t*charset = NULL;\\n    return status;\\n}\\n----------------\\n\\nAn included file above, \"Xlocaleint.h\", is also Xsi internal and we copied\\nthe file to the toolkit directory and compiled.\\n\\nA serious issue occured when we tried to compile a toolkit application on\\nour HP machine with its OS version of HP-UX9.01.\\n\\nWhen we tried to link an application based on our toolkit,\\nlink errors occured saying that the following functions are missing:\\n    _Xmbctidtocsid (code)\\n    _Xmbfscs (code)\\n    _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset (code)\\n    _XFallBackConvert (code)\\n\\nWe had used MIT release version of X11R5 and its Xsi implementation until\\nHP-UP9.0 and ran applications successfully.

And\\njudging from encouraging messages offered by the representatives of these\\npolitical groups and organizations, at least here in Greece, the Armenian\\nCause enjoys abundant support from a wide spectrum of the political world.\\n\\nThe International Meeting of Solidarity was sponsored by the Greek branch of\\nthe Armenian Popular Movement, a comparatively new political force headed\\nby younger generations of Armenians, who openly profess their support of the\\narmed struggle and of the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia\\n(ASALA). The organization has branches in various European and Middle Eastern\\ncountries and the United States although some of these branches appear to\\nhave gone through a switch of loyalties because of the split within the ranks\\nof ASALA...\\n\\nVoicing the support of PASOK, the ruling party in Greece, to the Armenian\\npeople, was Mr. Charalambidi Michalis, a member of the Central Committee of\\nthe party and the Greek member of the Permanent People\\'s Tribunal...\\nExplaining the goals and aspirations of the Armenian Popular Movement \\nwas Ara Sarkisian. Significant was the address delivered by Mr. Bassam \\nAbu-Salim, on behalf of the Popular Front for the movement\\'s continued \\nsupport of the Armenians\\' armed struggle in their pursuit of their cause, \\npledging that Palestinian operated and run training camps would always be \\nopen to Armenian youth who need training for such a struggle. Later, Mr. \\nAbu-Salim, answering a question put to him by this writer, affirmed that \\nhis organization had always trained Armenian members of ASALA and that\\nthis policy will continue. \"The doors of our camps are always open to \\nArmenian freedom fighters,\" he affirmed.\\n\\nAmong the prominent Greek politicians who attended the conference was the son\\nof Prime Minister Papandreou, who himself holds a post in the Greek cabinet;\\ntwo members of the Cypriot Parliament who had journeyed to Athens for the\\nspecific purpose of attending the international gathering; representatives of\\nthe Christian Democratic party, EDIK Center party, two wings of the Communist\\nparty, representatives of an assortment of labor unions and trade associations,\\na number of mayors of Greek towns and cities; two Greek members of the\\nEuropean Parliament and other members of the Greek Parliament were also among\\nthose who participated in the international conference.

But if we look at\\nthe past, we find that clutch patterns are just as likely to reverse\\nas they are to remain consistent.  The length of the streak doesn\\'t\\nseem to make a difference to the probability that the player will be\\nclutch or choke the next year.  Is there any reason to expect *this*\\nstreak to be different from past streaks?\\n\\nNow if it were true that \"75% of all three-year streaks remained true\\nto form\", then we might have something useful.  But then we wouldn\\'t\\nhave zero correlation.  Instead we have \"50% of all three-year streaks\\nremain true to form, and 50% of all three-year streaks reverse\".  You\\nlook at those numbers and say \"three year choke streak implies more\\nlikely to choke this year\".  But it would be equally valid to look at\\nthose numbers and say \"three year choke streak implies more likely to\\nbe clutch this year\", since the probabilities are split 50-50 each\\nway.\\n\\n>I completely accept that reasoning.  Again, what if we were to find\\n>the same individuals at each end of the spectrum on a consistent\\n>basis? \\n\\nThen we would have something useful.  And we would also have a\\npositive correlation.  But for every individual that exhibits such a\\npattern and holds true, there is another who exhibits such a pattern\\nand then reverses.\\n\\nCheers,\\n-Valentine\\n',\n",

Ludwig was a desciple of Russell. Ludwig\\'s fame is often\\nexplained by the fact that he spawned not one but two significant movements in\\ncontemporary philosophy. Both revolve around Tractatus Logico-Philosphicus\\n(\\'21) and Philosophical Investigation (\\'53).  Many of Witt\\'s comments and\\nimplicit conclusions suggest ways of going beyond the explicit critique of\\nlanguage he offers.  According to some of the implicit suggestions of Witt\\'s\\nthought, ordinary language is an invaluable resource, offering a necessary\\nframework for the conduct of daily life.  However, though its formal features\\nremain the same, its content does not and it is always capable of being\\ntranscended as our experience changes and our understanding is deepened, giving\\nus a clearer picture of what we are and what we wish to say.  On Witt\\'s own\\naccount, there is a dynamic fluidity of language.   It is for this reason that\\nany critique of language must move from talking about the limits of language to\\ntalking about its boundaries, where a boundary is understood not as a wall but\\na threshold.\\n  vonWrights\\'s comment that Witt\\'s \"sentences have a content that often lies\\ndeep beneath the surface of language.\"  On the surface, Witt talks of the\\ninsuperable position of ordinary language and the necessity of bringing\\nourselves to accept it without question.  At the same time, we are faced with\\nWitt\\'s own creative uses of language and his concern for bringing about changes\\nin our traditional modes of understanding.  Philosophy, then, through more\\nperspicacious speech, seeks to effect this unity rather than assuming that it\\nis already functioning. Yes?  The most brilliant of scientists are unable to\\noffer a foundation for human speech so long as they reject Christianity! In his\\nTractatus we have the well nigh perfect exhibition of the nature of the impasse\\nof the scientific ideal of exhaustive logical analysis of Reality by man. \\nPerfect language does not exist for fallen man, therefore we must get on about\\nour buisness of relating Truth via ordinary language.\\n\\n  This is why John\\'s Gospel is so dear to most Christians.  It is so simple in\\nit conveyance of the revealation of God, yet so full of unlieing depth of\\nunderstanding.  He viewed Christ from the OT concept of \"as a man thinketh, so\\nhe is.\"  John looked at the outward as only an indicator of what was inside,\\nthat is the consciousness of Christ.  And so must we.  Words are only vehicals\\nof truth.  He is truth.  The scriptures are plain in their expounding that\\nthere is a Truth and that it is knowable.  THere are absolutes, and they too\\nare knowable.  However, they are only knowable when He reveals them to the\\nindividual.  There is, and we shouldn\\'t shy from this, a mysticism to\\nChristianity.  Paul in ROm 8 says there are 3 men in the world.  There is the\\none who does not have the Spirit and therefore can not know the things of the\\nSpirit (the Spirit of Truth) and there is the one who has the Spirit and has\\nthe capacity to know of the Truth, but there  is the third.  THe one who not\\nonly has the Spirit, but that the Spirit has him! Who can know the deep things\\nof God and reveal them to us other than the Spirit.  And it is only the deep\\nthings of GOd that are absolute and true.\\n   There is such a thing as true truth and it is real, it can be experienced\\nand it is verifiable.  I disagree with Dr Nancy\\'s Sweetie\\'s conclusion because\\nif it is taken to fruition it leads to relativism which leads to dispair.  \\n\\n\"I would know the words which He would answer me, and understand what He would\\nsay unto me.\"  Job 23ff\\n\\n--Rex\\n\\nsuggested, easy reading about epistimology:  \"He is there and He is not Silent\"\\n by Francis Schaeffer.\\n',\n",

Too much can block the\\nexternal auditory canal (the hole in the outside of the ear) and cause some \\nhearing problems.  It is very simple, and safe, to remove excess wax on your\\nown, or at your physician's office.  You can take a syringe (no needles!) and\\nfill it with 50% warm water (cold can cause fainting) and 50% OTC hydrogen\\nperoxide.  Then point the ear towards the ceiling ( about 45 degrees up)\\nand insert the tip of the syringe (helps to have someone else do this!) and  \\nfirmly expell the solution.  Depending on the size of the syringe and the\\ntenacity of the wax, this could take several rinses.  If you place a bowl \\nunder the ear to catch the water, it will be much drier :-).  You can buy\\na syringe with a special tip at your local pharmacy, or just use whatever\\nyou may have.  If wax is old, it will be harder, and darker.  You can try\\nadding a few drops of olive oil into the ear during a shower to soften up\\nthe wax.  Do this for a couple days, then try syringing again.  It is also\\nsafe to point your ear up at the shower head, and allow the water to rinse\\nit out.\\nGood Luck\\n-heather\\n\",\n",

              "  'From: jhpb@sarto.budd-lake.nj.us (Joseph H. Buehler)\\nSubject: Re: SSPX schism ?\\nOrganization: none\\nLines: 182\\n\\nHere is some material by Michael Davies on the subject of schism in\\ngeneral and Archishop Lefebvre in particular.  He wrote it around\\n1990.  The first part of the two-part article was on the scandalous\\nactivities of Archbishop Weakland (in this country), but I cut all\\nthat.  And I pared down the rest to what was relevant.\\n\\nJoe Buehler\\n\\n...\\n\\nSchism and Disobedience\\n\\nAccording to St. Thomas Aquinas, schism consists primarily in a\\nrefusal of submission to the Pope or communion with the members of the\\nChurch united to him. On first sight it would appear that, whatever\\nthe subjective motivation of the Archbishop, as discussed above, he\\nmust be in a state of objective schism as he has refused to submit to\\nthe Pope on a very grave matter involving his supreme power of\\njurisdiction. However, standard Catholic textbooks of theology make it\\nclear that while all schisms involve disobedience not all acts of\\ndisobedience are schismatic. If this were so, as was noted at the\\nbeginning of this article, it would mean that the number of American\\nbishops who are not schismatic would not reach double figures.\\n\\nThe distinction between disobedience and schism is made very clear in\\nthe article on schism in the very authoritative Dictionnaire de\\nTheologie Catholique. The article is by Father Yves Congar who is\\ncertainly no friend of Archbishop Lefebvre.  He explains that schism\\nand disobedience are so similar that they are often confused. Father\\nCongar writes that schism involves a refusal to accept the existence\\nof legitimate authority in the Church, for example, Luther\\'s rejection\\nof the papacy. Father Congar explains that the refusal to accept a\\ndecision of legitimate authority in a particular instance does not\\nconstitute schism but disobedience.  The Catholic Encyclopedia\\nexplains that for a Catholic to be truly schismatic he would have to\\nintend \"to sever himself from the Church as far as in him lies.\"  It\\nadds that \"not every disobedience is schism; in order to possess this\\ncharacter it must include besides the transgression of the command of\\nthe superiors, a denial of their divine right to command.\"Not only\\ndoes Mgr. Lefebvre not deny the divine right of the Pope to command,\\nbut he affirms repeatedly his recognition of the Pope\\'s authority and\\nhis intention of never breaking away from Rome. The Archbishop made\\nhis attitude clear in the July/August 1989 issue of 30 Days: \"We pray\\nfor the Pope every day. Nothing has changed with the consecrations\\nlast June 30. We are not sedevacantists. We recognize in John Paul II\\nthe legitimate Pope of the Catholic Church. We don\\'t even say that he\\nis a heretical Pope. We only say that his Modernist actions favor\\nheresy.\"\\n\\n...\\n\\nIntrinsically Schismatic?\\n\\nThe principal argument used by those claiming that Mgr. Lefebvre is in\\nschism is that the consecration of a bishop without a papal mandate is\\nan intrinsically schismatic act. A bishop who carries out such a\\nconsecration, it is claimed, becomes ipso facto a schismatic. This is\\nnot true. If such a consecration is an intrinsically schismatic act it\\nwould always have involved the penalty of excommunication. In the 1917\\nCode of Canon Law the offence was punished only by suspension (see\\nCanon 2370 of the 1917 Code). Pope Pius XII had raised the penalty to\\nexcommunication as a response to the establishment of a schismatic\\nchurch in China. The consecration of these illicit Chinese bishops\\ndiffered radically from the consecrations carried out by Mgr. Lefebvre\\nas the professed intention was to repudiate the authority of the Pope,\\nthat is, to deny that he has the right to govern the Church, and the\\nillicitly consecrated Chinese bishops were given a mandate to exercise\\nan apostolic mission. Neither Archbishop Lefebvre nor any of the\\nbishops he has consecrated claim that they have powers of\\njurisdiction. They have been consecrated solely for the purpose of\\nensuring the survival of the Society by carrying out ordinations and\\nalso to perform confirmations. I do not wish to minimize in any way\\nthe gravity of the step take by Mgr. Lefebvre. The consecration of\\nbishops without a papal mandate is far more serious matter than the\\nordination of priests as it involves a refusal in practice of the\\nprimacy or jurisdiction belonging by divine right to the Roman\\nPontiff. But the Archbishop could argue that the crisis afflicting the\\nChurch could not be more grave, and that grave measures were needed in\\nresponse.\\n\\nIt appears to be taken for granted by most of the Archbishop\\'s critics\\nthat he was excommunicated for the offense of schism, and the Vatican\\nhas certainly been guilty of fostering this impression.  There is not\\nso much as a modicum of truth in this allegation. The New Code of\\nCanon Law includes a section beginning with Canon 1364 entitled\\n\"Penalties for Specific Offenses\" (De Poenis in Singula Dicta). The\\nfirst part deals with \"Offenses against Religion and the Unity of the\\nChurch\" (De Delictis contra Religionem et Ecclesiae Unitatem). Canon\\n1364 deals with the offense of schism which is, evidently, together\\nwith apostasy and heresy, one of the three fundamental offenses\\nagainst the unity of the Church.\\n\\nBut the Archbishop was not excommunicated under the terms of this\\ncanon or, indeed, under any canon involving an offense against\\nreligion or the unity of the church. The canon cited in his\\nexcommunication comes from the third section of \"Penalties for\\nSpecific Offenses\" which is entitled \"Usurpation of Ecclesial\\nFunctions and Offenses in their Exercise\" (De Munerum Ecclesiasticorum\\nUsurpatione Degue Delictis iniis Exercendis). The canon in question is\\nCanon 1382, which reads: \"A bishop who consecrates someone bishop and\\nthe person who receives such a consecration from a bishop without a\\npontifical mandate incur an automatic (latae sententiae)\\nexcommunication reserved to the Holy See.\"\\n\\nThe scandalous attempts to smear Archbishop Lefebvre with the offense\\nof schism are, then, contrary to both truth and charity. A comparable\\nsmear under civil as opposed to ecclesiastical law would certainly\\njustify legal action for libel involving massive damages. An accurate\\nparallel would be to state that a man convicted of manslaughter had\\nbeen convicted of first degree murder.\\n\\nI must stress that what I have written here is not the dubious opinion\\nof laymen unversed in the intricacies of Canon Law. Canon lawyers\\nwithout the least shred of sympathy for Mgr. Lefebvre have repudiated\\nthe charge of schism made against him as totally untenable. Father\\nPatrick Yaldrini, Dean of the Faculty of Canon Law of the Institut\\nCatholique in Paris noted in the 4 July 1988 issue of Valeurs\\nactuelles that, as I have just explained, Mgr.  Lefebvre was not\\nexcommunicated for schism but for the usurpation of an ecclesiastical\\nfunction. He added that it is not the consecration of a bishop which\\nconstitutes schism but the conferral of an apostolic mission upon the\\nillicitly consecrated bishop. It is this usurpation of the powers of\\nthe sovereign pontiff which proves the intention of establishing a\\nparallel Church.\\n\\nCardinal Rosalio Lara, President of the Pontifical Commission for the\\nAuthentic Interpretation of Canon Law, commented on the consecrations\\nin the 10 July 1988 issue of la Repubblica. It would be hard to\\nimagine a more authoritative opinion. The Cardinal wrote:\\n\\n    The act of consecrating a bishop (without a papal mandate) is not\\n    in itself a schismatic act. In fact, the Code that deals with\\n    offenses is divided into two sections. One deals with offenses\\n    against religion and the unity of the Church, and these are\\n    apostasy, schism, and heresy. Consecrating a bishop with a\\n    pontifical mandate is, on the contrary, an offense against the\\n    exercise of a specific ministry. For example, in the case of the\\n    consecrations carried out by the Vietnamese Archbishop Ngo Dinh\\n    Thuc in 1976 and 1983, although the Archbishop was excommunicated\\n    he was not considered to have committed a schismatic act because\\n    there was no intention of a breach with the Church.\\n\\n....\\n\\nIt is not simply unjust but ludicrous to suggest that in consecrating\\nbishops without a papal mandate Archbishop Lefebvre had the least\\nintent of establishing a schismatic church. He is not a schismatic and\\nwill never be a schismatic. The Archbishop considers correctly that\\nthe the Church is undergoing its worst crisis since the Arian heresy,\\nand that for the good of the Church it was necessary for him to\\nconsecrate the four bishops to ensure the future of his Society. Canon\\nLaw provides for just such a situation, and even if one believes that\\nthe future of the Society could have been guaranteed without these\\nconsecrations, the fact that the Archbishop believed sincerely that it\\ncould not means, as Canon Law states clearly, that he has not incurred\\nexcommunication. Furthermore, while the Vatican allows such prelates\\nas Archbishop Weakland to undermine the Faith with impunity it cannot\\nexpect Catholics to pay the least attention to its sanctions against a\\ngreat and orthodox Archbishop whose entire life has been devoted to\\nthe service of the Church and the salvation of souls.\\n\\nDr. Eric M. de Saventhem, President of the International Una Voce\\nAssociation, is one of the best informed laymen in the Church, and he\\nknows the Archbishop intimately. Dr. de Saventhem, like myself, has no\\ngreater desire than to see a reconciliation between Mgr. Lefebvre and\\nthe Holy See during the Archbishop\\'s lifetime. A quotation from a\\nstatement by Dr. de Saventhem which was published in the 15 February\\n1989 Remnant merits careful study:\\n\\n    In retrospect, the road leading to the consecrations of 30 June\\n    appears more paved with grave Roman (and, unfortunately, also\\n    papal) omissions than with Lefebvrist \"obstinancies.\" And from the\\n    eyes of an informed public this cannot be hidden by attempting to\\n    present the Archbishop\\'s act of grave disobedience as an offense\\n    against the Faith!  It is said--today--that Mgr. Lefebvre has \"an\\n    erroneous concept of Tradition.\" If this were so, Cardinal\\n    Ratzinger could not, on behalf of the Pope, have addressed to the\\n    Archbishop the following words in his letter of 28 July 1987:\\n    \"Your ardent desire to safeguard Tradition by procuring for it\\n    \\'the means to live and prosper\\' testifies to your attachment to\\n    the Faith of all time... the Holy Father understands your concern\\n    and shares it.\"\\n',\n",

Frankly, if you're not an absolutist, your\\nfeelings may turn on some of these issues.  For example -- with an\\n80-bit key, simply splitting it into two 40-bit pieces is much less\\nacceptable than other schemes, because it means that if just one\\nrepository is, shall we say, overly pliable, a would-be eavesdropper\\nwould need to recover just 40 more bits of key.  I need not point out\\nin this newsgroup that that's pretty easy to do by exhaustive search.\\nA slightly more complex scheme -- XOR-ing the key with a random number,\\nand then with its complement -- would produce two 80-bit subkeys,\\nneither of which is useful alone.  That variant is much more resistant\\nto attack.  Clearly, one can get even more sophisticated, to protect\\nthe subkeys even more.\\n\\nOther thoughts...  Some people have noted the size and complexity of\\nthe databases necessary.  But the id strings the phones emit could be\\ntheir back door key, double-encrypted with the escrow repositories'\\npublic keys.  For that matter, they could do that only with session\\nkeys, and have no back door at all.  In that case, the FBI would have\\nto bring every intercept to the repositories to be decrypted.  This\\nwould answer many of the objections along the lines of ``how do you\\nmake sure they stop''.\\n\\nWe can even combine that with a variant of the digital telephony back\\ndoor -- have the switch do the tap, but with a digitally-signed record\\nof the time, phone number, etc, of the call.  That provides proof to\\nthe escrow agents that the tap was done in compliance with the terms of\\nthe warrant.\\n\\nI can suggest other variations, too.  Suppose each Clipper chip had 100\\npublic key pairs.  Each would be used ~10 times, after which you'd need\\nmore keying material.  (Not a bad idea in any event.)  This could be\\nused to enforce time limits, or rather, usage limits, on each warrant;\\nthe keys the repository agents would deliver wouldn't last for very\\nlong.\\n\\nI suspect that the cryptographic algorithm itself is secure.  Apart from\\nthe obvious -- why push a weak algorithm when you've already got the\\nback door? -- I think that the government is still genuinely concerned\\nabout foreign espionage, especially aimed at commercial targets.  This\\nscheme lets the spooks have their cake and eat it, too.  (I've heard\\nrumors, over the years, that some factions within NSA were unhappy with\\nDES because it was too good.  Not that they couldn't crack it, but it\\nwas much too expensive to do so as easily as they'd want.)  They're keeping\\nthe details secret so that others don't build their own implementations\\nwithout the back door.\\n\\nThe cryptographic protocol, though, is another matter.  I see no valid\\nreasons for keeping it secret, and -- as I hope I've shown above -- there\\nare a lot of ways to do things that aren't (quite) as bad.\\n\",\n",

A button widget, when pressed, will cause a new item\\nto be drawn in the Window.  This action clearly should not call XCopyArea() \\n(or equiv) directly; instead, it should register the existence of the new\\nitem in a memory structure and let the same expose event handler that handles\\n\"regular\" expose events (e.g. window manager-driven exposures) take care\\nof rendering the new image.  Using an expose event handler is a \"proper\" way\\nto do this because at the time the handler is called, the Xlib Window is\\nguaranteed to be mapped.\\n\\nThe problem, of course, is that no expose event is generated if the window\\nis already visible and mapped.  What we need to do is somehow \"tickle\" the\\nWindow so that the expose handler is hit with arguments that will enable\\nit to render *just* the part of the window that contains the new item.\\n\\nWhat is the best way to tickle a window to produce this behavior?\\n',\n",

I have no particular plan (except to do\\nmy bit - personal ethics AND social work). My opinion (for what it is worth)\\nis that the Authority for each Moral must be increased somehow, and that this\\nwill probably take several generations to be effective. I don\\'t think that the\\nlist of Morals has changed for Society significantly, though . The Authority element\\nmay come from our authority figures and roles models (see Eric Berne and his\\ntransactional analysis work [+ Mavis Klein] for references) and this is what\\ngives rise to a deterioration of moral standards in the long term.\\n\\nI\\'ve had some more thoughts on my definitions:\\n\\nI\\'ve was thinking that I should add Moral Character to the list of definitions\\nin order to get a dynamic version of the Moral Nature (ie. the interplay of\\nthe Moral Code and associated Authorities). A suitable analogy might be a\\ngraphic equaliser on a HiFi system - the Moral Nature being the set of\\nfrequencies and the chosen \\'amplitudes\\', and the Moral Character being the\\nspectrum over time.\\n\\nConscience is a little more difficult because I can\\'t define it as the\\nreasoning of a person between actions in the context of his Moral Nature\\nbecause Conscience seems to cut in most of the time unbidden and often\\nunwanted. I think Conscience is manifest when a decision is made at a given\\ntime which compromises one\\'s Moral Nature. My Conscience fits in more with\\nFreud\\'s SuperEgo (plus the Moral Driver) with the stimulous being the\\nurges or Freud\\'s Id. The reasoning that I mentioned before is Freud\\'s Ego,\\nI suppose. If the Moral Driver is part of the Id then the reason why\\nConscience cuts in unbidden is partially explained. The question is \"what\\nprovides the stimulous to activate the Moral driver?\". I think I need some\\nmore time with this one.\\n\\nThat\\'s about it for now!\\n\\nDavid.\\n\\n---\\nOn religion:\\n\\n\"Oh, where is the sea?\", the fishes cried,\\nAs they swam its clearness through.\\n\\n',\n",

The SQ-80 is a powerful performance\\noriented synth with a limited on-board sequencer.  I bought it because\\nit has a very large timbral repertoire;  it seems to do meaty analog\\nsynth sounds as well as sounds that are considerably more \"digital\".\\nBelow are a list of features extracted from the owner\\'s manual:\\n  o Eight-voice polyphonic poly-timbral synthesizer, capable of\\n    playing eight different sounds at once, with dynamic stereo\\n    panning for each voice\\n  o Voice section employing Cross-Wave synthesis;  combine different\\n    attack and sustain wave segments to create complex, dynamic sounds\\n  o 75 sampled waves (includes a drumset) serve as the sound source\\n  o Dynamic voice allocation:  each sequencer track/MIDI channel has\\n    access to all eight voices\\n  o A full-featured MIDI controller keyboard capable of sending eight\\n    MIDI program and volume changes at once.  Keyboard is velocity\\n    sensitive, and transmits/receives velocity and polyphonic aftertouch.\\n  o Powerful matrix modulation scheme allows a very wide range of \\n    modulation sources and routings.\\n  o A 3.5\" floppy disk drive which writes/reads ordinary DS/DD disks\\n    allows fast and reliable storage of up to 600 sequences and up to\\n    1728 sound patches on a single floppy disk.  Also has a RAM-cart slot\\n    for patches that is compatible with ESQ-1 RAM-carts.\\n  o Does sysex dumps to its floppy disk for any sysex capable MIDI device\\n  o 80 character fluorescent display and user-friendly \"page-driven\"\\n    programming scheme provides a fairly humane user interface\\n  o Stereo line-outs, and stereo headphone jack for private listening\\n  o Sound programs and sequences are upwardly compatible with the ESQ-1\\n    so that sounds and sequences created for the ESQ-1 can be played on\\n    the SQ-80.\\n\\nThis SQ-80 has been the main MIDI controller in my studio for quite a while\\nnow.  It has performed ably in that role, and has also been a heavily\\nused sound source at the same time.  The SQ-80 seems to have been designed\\nwith this role in mind, and it works very well with my software sequencer\\n(WinCake) in its multitimbral mode.\\n\\n>From a synthesis point of view, this machine is a hybrid.  It uses looped\\nshort samples (there are 75 of them) as sources, then these waves\\nare processed with a sophisticated DCF-DCA arrangement.  The SQ-80\\nis capable of great things because of its 4-pole analog lowpass filter.\\nSimply put, it makes fabulous analog synth sounds.  But unlike most\\ngood analog synths, it has a very thorough MIDI implementation so that it\\nworks very well with a MIDI sequencer.  What I really like most about this\\nthing is that it is capable of making a very wide range of sounds.\\nThis SQ-80 is about 5 years old (mfg. date 1/21/88).  It does have\\nan 8-track sequencer, but like most on-board sequencers, it is a pain\\nto use so I have avoided it.\\n\\nREASON FOR SALE:\\nI am selling my SQ-80 because I recently joined forces with another individual\\nhere in Boston, and we have more keyboards than space to put them.  I\\nrecommend it for someone who is getting started in sequencing and needs a\\npowerful but economical master keyboard.\\n\\nPRICING AND TERMS:\\nI paid $1300.00 for this synth a few years ago.  I am willing to accept\\n$650.00 (average r.m.m.s asking price is $733.00).  I will include a bunch of \\npatches on SQ-80 floppy disks for the buyer of this synth, as well as the \\noriginal Ensoniq SQ-80 owner\\'s manual.\\n\\nPrice:    Asking $650.00 (everything)\\nShipping: split shipping (UPS Surface COD) anywhere in the lower 48 states\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nCraig Vanderborgh                                         Verbex Voice Systems\\ne-mail:  craigv@rad.verbex.com                            119 Russell Street\\nphone: (508) 486-8886                                     Littleton, MA 01460\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\n',\n",

EDT\\n\\t     \\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Terry, do you have a question?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, there\\'s a growing feeling that the \\nWestern response to bloodshed in Bosnia has been woefully inadequate.  \\nHolocaust survivor Elie Wiesel asked you yesterday to do something, \\nanything to stop the fighting.  Is the United States considering \\ntaking unilateral action such as air strikes against Serb artillery \\nsites?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first let me say, as you know, for \\nmore than a week now we have been seriously reviewing our options for \\nfurther action.  And I want to say, too, let\\'s look at the last three \\nmonths.  Since I became President I have worked with our allies and \\nwe have tried to move forward, first on the no-fly zone, on \\nenforcement of it, on the humanitarian airdrops, on the war crimes \\ninvestigation, on getting the Bosnian Muslims involved in the peace \\nprocess.  We have made some progress.  And now we have a very much \\ntougher sanctions resolution.  And Leon Fuerth, who is the National \\nSecurity Advisor to the Vice President, is in Europe now working on \\nimplementing that.  That is going to make a big difference to Serbia.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And we are reviewing other options.  I think we should \\nact.  We should lead -- the United States should lead.  We have led \\nfor the last three months.  We have moved the coalition.  And to be \\nfair, our allies in Europe have been willing to do their part.  And \\nthey have troops on the ground there.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     But I do not think we should act alone, unilaterally, \\nnor do I think we will have to.  And in the next several days I think \\nwe will finalize the extensive review which has been going on and \\nwhich has taken a lot of my time, as well as the time of the \\nadministration, as it should have, over the last 10 days or so.  I \\nthink we\\'ll finish that in the near future and then we\\'ll have a \\npolicy and we\\'ll announce it and everybody can evaluate it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Can I follow up?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Sure.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you see any parallel between the ethnic \\ncleansing in Bosnia and the Holocaust?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I think the Holocaust is on a whole \\ndifferent level.  I think it is without precedent or peer in human \\nhistory.  On the other hand, ethnic cleansing is the kind of \\ninhumanity that the Holocaust took to the nth degree.  The idea of \\nmoving people around and abusing them and often killing them solely \\nbecause of their ethnicity is an abhorrent thing.  And it is \\nespecially troublesome in that area where people of different ethnic \\ngroups live side by side for so long together.  And I think you have \\nto stand up against it.  I think it\\'s wrong.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     We were talking today about all of the other troubles in \\nthat region.  I was happy to see the violence between the Croats and \\nthe Muslims in Bosnia subside this morning, and I think we\\'re making \\nprogress on that front.  But what\\'s going on with the Serbians and \\nthe ethnic cleansing is qualitatively different than the other \\nconflicts, both within the former Yugoslavia and in other parts of \\nthe region.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, by any count, you have not had a \\ngood week in your presidency.  The tragedy in Waco, the defeat of \\nyour stimulus bill, the standoff in Bosnia.  What did you do wrong \\nand what are you going to do differently?  How do you look at things?  \\nAre you reassessing?  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I don\\'t really believe that the \\nsituation in Bosnia -- it\\'s not been a good week for the world, but I \\ndon\\'t know that the administration could have made it different.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     On the stimulus package, I\\'d like to put it into the \\nlarger context and remind you that in this 100 days we have already \\nfundamentally changed the direction of an American government.  We \\nhave abandoned trickle-down economics.  We\\'ve abandoned the policies \\nthat brought the debt of this country from $1 trillion to $4 trillion \\nin only a decade.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     The budget plan, which passed the Congress, which will \\nreduce the deficit and increase investment, has led to a 20-year low \\nin mortgage rates, dramatically lower interest rates.  There are \\nprobably people in this room who have refinanced their home mortgages \\nin the last three months, or who have had access to cheaper credit.  \\nThat\\'s going to put tens of billion dollars coursing throughout this \\neconomy in ways that are very, very good for the country.  And so we \\nare moving in the right direction economically.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I regret that the stimulus did not pass, and I have \\nbegun to ask -- and will continue to ask not only people in the \\nadministration, but people in the Congress whether there is something \\nI could have done differently to pass that.  Part of the reason it \\ndidn\\'t pass was politics; part of it was a difference in ideas.  \\nThere are really people still who believe that it\\'s not needed.  I \\njust disagree with that.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I think the recovery -- the economists say it\\'s been \\nunderway for about two years, and we\\'ve still had 16 months of seven-\\npercent unemployment, and all the wealthy countries are having \\ntrouble creating jobs.  So I think there was an idea base -- an \\nargument there, that while we\\'re waiting for the lower interest rates \\nand the deficit reduction and the investments of the next four years \\nto take effect, this sort of supplemental appropriation should go \\nforward.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Now, I have to tell you, I did misgauge that because a \\nmajority of the Republican senators now sitting in the Senate voted \\nfor a similar stimulus when Ronald Reagan was President in 1983, and \\nvoted 28 times for regular supplemental appropriations like this.  I \\njust misgauged it.  And I hope that I can learn something.  I\\'ve just \\nbeen here 90 days.  And, you know, I was a Governor working with a \\ncontentious legislature for 12 years, and it took me a decade to get \\npolitical reform there.  So it takes time  to change things.  But I \\nbasically feel very good about what\\'s happened in the first 100 days \\nwith regard to the Congress.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Waco --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, with regard to Waco I don\\'t have \\nmuch to add to what I\\'ve already said.  I think it is a -- I want the \\nsituation looked into.  I want us to bring in people who have any \\ninsights to bear on that.  I think it\\'s very important that the whole \\nthing be thoroughly gone over.  But I still maintain what I said from \\nthe beginning, that the offender there was David Koresh.  And I do \\nnot think the United States government is responsible for the fact \\nthat a bunch of fanatics decided to kill themselves.  And I\\'m sorry \\nthat they killed their children.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, to follow up partly on Helen on your \\nstimulus package and on your political approach to Capitol Hill, Ross \\nPerot said today that you\\'re playing games with the American people \\nin your tax policy.  He was strongly critical of your stimulus \\npackage.  He said he\\'s going to launch an advertising campaign \\nagainst the North American Free Trade Agreement.  How are you going \\nto handle his political criticism?  Will it complicate your efforts \\non the Hill with your economic plan?  And do you plan to repackage \\nsome of the things that have been in your stimulus program and try to \\nresubmit them to the Hill?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Let me answer that question first.  \\nWe\\'re going to revisit all of that over the next few days.  I\\'m going \\nto be talking to members of Congress and to others to see what we can \\ndo about that.  With regard to the economic plan, I must say I found \\nthat rather amazing.  I don\\'t want to get into an argument with Mr. \\nPerot.  I\\'ll be interested to hear what his specifics are, but I \\nwould -- go back and read his book and his plan.  There\\'s a \\nremarkable convergence except that we have more specific budget cuts, \\nwe raise taxes less on the middle class and more on the wealthy.  \\nBut, otherwise, the plans are remarkably similar.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     So I think it would be -- I\\'ll be interested to see if \\nmaybe perhaps he\\'s changed his position from his book last year and \\nhe has some new ideas to bring to bear.  I\\'ll be glad to hear them.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  To follow up, sir, how do you plan to handle his \\npolitical criticism?  He\\'s launched a campaign against you.  Do you \\nthink you can sit back and just --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, I will ask you to \\napply the same level of scrutiny to him as you do to me.  And if he\\'s \\nchanged his position from the positions he took in the campaign last \\nyear, then we need to know why and what his ideas are.  Maybe he\\'s \\ngot some constructive ideas.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I think the American people have shown that they\\'re very \\nimpatient with people who don\\'t want to produce results.  And the one \\nthing I think that everybody has figured out about me in the last -- \\neven if they don\\'t agree with what I do -- is that I want to get \\nsomething done.  I just came here to try to change things.  I want to \\ndo things.  And I want to do things that help people\\'s lives.  So my \\njudgment is that if he makes a suggestion that is good, that is \\nconstructive, that takes us beyond some idea I\\'ve proposed that will \\nchange people\\'s lives for the better, fine.  But I think that that \\nought to be the test that we apply to everyone who weighs into this \\ndebate and not just to the President.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, to go back to Bosnia for a minute.  \\nYou continue to insist that this has to be multilateral action, a \\ncriteria that seems to have hamstrung us when it comes to many \\noptions thus far and makes it look as if this is a state of \\nparalysis.  The United States is the last remaining superpower.  Why \\nis it not appropriate in this situation for the United States to act \\nunilaterally?\\n\\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, the United States -- surely you \\nwould agree, that the United States, even as the last remaining \\nsuperpower, has to act consistent with international law under some \\nmandate of the United Nations.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  But you have a mandate and --\\n\\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  They do, and that is one of the things \\nthat we have under review.  I haven\\'t ruled out any option for \\naction.  I would remind all of you, I have not ruled out any option, \\nexcept that we have not discussed and we are not considering the \\nintroduction of American forces into continuing hostilities there.  \\nWe are not.  \\n\\n\\t     So we are reviewing other options.  But I also would \\nremind you that, to be fair, our allies have had -- the French, the \\nBritish and the Canadians -- have had troops on the ground there.  \\nThey have been justifiably worried about those.  But they have \\nsupported the airdrops, the toughening of the sanctions.  They \\nwelcomed the American delegation now in Europe, working on how to \\nmake these sanctions really work and really bite against Serbia.  And \\nI can tell you that the other nations involved are also genuinely \\nreassessing their position, and I would not rule out the fact that we \\ncan reach an agreement for a concerted action that goes beyond where \\nwe have been.  I don\\'t have any criticism of the British, the French \\nand others about that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Would that be military action?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, several of the leading lights in \\nyour administration, ranging from your FBI Director to your U.N. \\nAmbassador, to your Deputy Budget Director to your Health Services \\nSecretary, have issued statements in the last couple of weeks which \\nare absolutely contradictory to some of the positions you\\'ve taken in \\nyour administration.  Why is that?  Are you losing your political \\ngrip?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Give me an example. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Example?  Judge Sessions said that there was no \\nchild abuse in Waco.  Madeleine Albright has said in this morning\\'s \\nnewspapers, at least, that she favors air strikes in Bosnia.  All of \\nthese are things you said that you didn\\'t support.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  First of all, I don\\'t know what -- we \\nknow that David Koresh had sex with children.  I think that is \\nundisputed, is it not?  Is it not?  Does anybody dispute that?  Where \\nI come from that qualifies as child abuse.  And we know that he had \\npeople teaching these kids how to kill themselves.  I think that \\nqualifies as abuse.  And I\\'m not criticizing Judge Sessions because I \\ndon\\'t know exactly what he said.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     In terms of Madeleine Albright, Madeleine Albright has \\nmade no public statement at all about air strikes.  There is a press \\nreport that she wrote me a confidential letter in which she expressed \\nher -- or memo -- in which she expressed her views about the new \\ndirection we should take in response to my request to all the senior \\nmembers of my administration to let me know what they thought we \\nought to do next.  And I have heard from her and from others about \\nwhat they think we ought to do next.  And I\\'m not going to discuss \\nthe recommendations they made to me, but in the next few days when I \\nmake a decision about what to do, then I will announce what I\\'m going \\nto do.  So I wouldn\\'t say that either one of those examples qualifies \\nspeaking out of school.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  How about the Value Added Tax, Mr. President?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  What was that?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The Value Added Tax -- Mrs. Rivlin and Miss Shalala \\nboth said that they thought that that was a good idea.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I don\\'t mind them saying they think it\\'s \\na good idea.  There are all kinds of arguments for it on policy \\ngrounds.  That does not mean that we have decided to incorporate it \\nin the health care debate.  No decision has been made on that.  And I \\nhave no objection to their expressing their views on that.  We\\'ve had \\na lot of people from business and labor come to us saying that they \\nthought that tax would help make their particular industries more \\ncompetitive in the global economy.  I took no -- that wasn\\'t taking a \\nline against an administration policy.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, a week ago a group of gay and \\nlesbian representatives came out of a meeting with you and expressed \\nin the most ringing terms, their confidence in your understanding of \\nthem and their political aspirations, and their belief that you would \\nfulfill those aspirations.  Do you feel now that you will be able to \\nmeet their now enhanced expectations?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I don\\'t know about that.  And I \\ndon\\'t know what their -- it depends on what the expectations are.  \\nBut I\\'ll tell you this:  I believe that this country\\'s policies \\nshould be heavily biased in favor of nondiscrimination.  I believe \\nwhen you tell people they can\\'t do certain things in this country \\nthat other people can do, there ought to be an overwhelming and \\ncompelling reason for it.  I believe we need the services of all of \\nour people, and I have said that consistently.  And not as a \\npolitical proposition.  The first time this issue came up was in 1991 \\nwhen I was in Boston.  I was just asked the question about it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And I might add -- it\\'s interesting that I have been \\nattacked -- obviously, those who disagree with me here are primarily \\ncoming from the political right in America.  When I was Governor, I \\nwas attacked from the other direction for sticking up for the rights \\nof religious fundamentalists to run their child care centers and to \\npractice home schooling under appropriate safeguards.  I just have \\nalways had an almost libertarian view that we should try to protect \\nthe rights of American individual citizens to live up to the fullest \\nof their capacities, and I\\'m going to stick right with that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Are you concerned, sir, that you may have generated \\nexpectations on their end and criticism among others that has \\nhamstrung your administration in the sense of far too great emphasis \\non this issue?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Yes, but I have not placed a great deal \\nof emphasis on it.  It\\'s gotten a lot of emphasis in other quarters \\nand in the press.  I\\'ve just simply taken my position and tried to \\nsee it through.  And that\\'s what I do.  It doesn\\'t take a lot of my \\ntime as President to say what I believe in and what I intend to do, \\nand that\\'s what I\\'ll continue to do.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, getting back to the situation in \\nBosnia -- and we understand you haven\\'t made any final decisions on \\nnew options previously considered unacceptable.  But the two most \\ncommonly heard options would be lifting the arms embargo to enable \\nthe Bosnian Muslims to defend themselves and to initiate some limited \\nair strikes, perhaps, to cut off supply lines.  Without telling us \\nyour decision -- presumably, you haven\\'t made any final decisions on \\nthose two options -- what are the pros and cons that are going \\nthrough your mind right now and will weigh heavily on your final \\ndecision?  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I\\'m reluctant to get into this.  There \\nare -- those are two of the options.  There are some other options \\nthat have been considered.  All have pluses and minuses; all have \\nsupporters and opponents within the administration and in the \\nCongress, where, I would remind you, heavy consultations will be \\nrequired to embark on any new policy.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I do believe that on the air strike issue, the \\npronouncements that General Powell has made generally about military \\naction, apply there.  If you take action, if the United States takes \\naction, we must have a clearly-defined objective that can be met.  We \\nmust be able to understand it and its limitations must be clear.  The \\nUnited States is not, should not, become involved as a partisan in a \\nwar.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     With regard to the lifting of the arms embargo, the \\nquestion obviously there is if you widen the capacity of people to \\nfight will that help to get a settlement and bring about peace?  Will \\nit lead to more bloodshed?  What kind of reaction can others have \\nthat would undermine the effectiveness of the policy?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     But I think both of them deserve some serious \\nconsideration, along with some other options we have.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you think that these people who are trying to \\nget us into war in Bosnia are really remembering that we haven\\'t \\ntaken care of hundreds of thousands of veterans from the last war and \\nwe couldn\\'t take care of our prisoners and get them all home from \\nVietnam?   And now many of them are coming up with bills for \\ntreatment of Agent Orange.  How can we afford to go to any more of \\nthese wars?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think that\\'s a good argument \\nagainst the United States itself becoming involved as a belligerent \\nin a war there.  But we are, after all, the world\\'s only super power.  \\nWe do have to lead the world  and there is a very serious problem of \\nsystematic ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia, which could \\nhave not only enormous further humanitarian consequences -- and \\ngoodness knows there have been many -- but also could have other \\npractical consequences in other nearby regions where the same sorts \\nof ethnic tensions exist.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  Did you make any kind of agreement with Boris \\nYeltsin to hold off either on air strikes or any kind of aggressive \\naction against the Serbs until after Sunday?  And in general, how has \\nhis political situation affected your deliberation on Bosnia?\\n\\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  No, I have not made any agreement, and \\nhe did not ask for that.  We never even discussed that, interestingly \\nenough.  The Russians, I would remind you, in the middle of President \\nYeltsin\\'s campaign, abstained from our attempt to get tougher \\nsanctions through the United Nations in what I thought was the proper \\ndecision for them and one that the United States and, I\\'m sure, the \\nrest of the free world very much appreciated. \\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you wish, Mr. President, that you\\'d become more \\ninvolved in the planning of the Waco operation?  And how would you \\nhandle that situation differently now?\\n\\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I don\\'t think as a practical matter that \\nthe President should become involved in the planning of those kinds \\nof things at that detail.  One of the things that I\\'m sure will come \\nout when we look into this is -- the questions will be asked and \\nanswered, did all of us who up the line of command ask the questions \\nwe should have asked and get the answers we should have gotten?  And \\nI look forward to that.  But at the time, I have to say, as I did \\nbefore, the first thing I did after the ATF agents were killed, once \\nwe knew that the FBI was going to go in, was to ask that the military \\nbe consulted because of the quasi, as least, military nature of the \\nconflict given the resources that Koresh had in his compound and \\ntheir obvious willingness to use them.  And then on the day before \\nthe action, I asked the questions of the Attorney General which I \\nhave reported to you previously, and which at the time I thought were \\nsufficient.  I have -- as I said, I\\'m sure -- I leave it to others to \\nmake the suggestions about whether there are other questions I should \\nhave asked.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, what is your assessment of Director \\nSessions\\' role in the Waco affair?  And have you made a decision on \\nhis future?  And if you haven\\'t, will you give him a personal hearing \\nbefore you do decide?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, I have no assessment \\nof his role since I had no direct contact with him.  And I mean no \\nnegative or positive inference.  I have no assessment there.  I stand \\nby what I said before about my general high regard for the FBI.  And \\nI\\'m waiting for a recommendation from the Attorney General about what \\nto do with the direction of the FBI.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, since you said that one side in \\nBosnia conflict represents inhumanity that the Holocaust carried to \\nthe nth degree, why do you then tell us that the United States cannot \\ntake a partisan view in this war?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I said that the principle of \\nethnic cleansing is something we ought to stand up against.  That \\ndoes not mean that the United States or the United Nations can enter \\na war, in effect, to redraw the lines, geographical lines of \\nrepublics within what was Yugoslavia, or that that would ultimately \\nbe successful.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I think what the United States has to do is to try to \\nfigure out whether there is some way consistent with forcing the \\npeople to resolve their own difficulties we can stand up to and stop \\nethnic cleansing.  And that is obviously the difficulty we are \\nwrestling with.  This is clearly the most difficult foreign policy \\nproblem we face, and that all of our allies face.  And if it were \\neasy, I suppose it would have been solved before.  We have tried to \\ndo more in the last 90 days than was previously done.  It has clearly \\nnot been enough to stop the Serbian aggression, and  we are now \\nlooking at what else we can do.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Yesterday you specifically criticized the Roosevelt \\nadministration for not having bombed the railroads to the \\nconcentration camps and things that were near military targets.  \\nAren\\'t there steps like that that would not involve conflict --direct \\nconflict or partisan belligerence that you might consider?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  There may be.  I would remind you that \\nthe circumstances were somewhat different.  We were then at war with \\nGermany at the time and that\\'s what made that whole incident so --\\nseries of incidents -- so perplexing.  But we have -- as I say, we\\'ve \\ngot all of our options under review.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The diplomatic initiative on Haiti is on the verge \\nof collapse.  What can you do to salvage it short of a full-scale \\nmilitary operation?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, you may know something I don\\'t.  \\nThat\\'s not what our people tell me.  I think Mr. Caputo and \\nAmbassador Pezzullo have done together a good job.  The thing keeps \\ngoing back and forth because of the people who are involved with the \\nde facto government there.  It\\'s obvious what their concerns are.  \\nThey were the same concerns that led to the ouster of Aristide in the \\nfirst place, and President Aristide, we feel, should be restored to \\npower.  We\\'re working toward that.  I get a report on that -- we \\ndiscuss it at least three times a week, and I\\'m convinced that we\\'re \\ngoing to prevail there and be successful.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I do believe that there\\'s every reason to think that \\nthere will have to be some sort of multilateral presence to try to \\nguarantee the security and the freedom from violence of people on \\nboth sides of the ledger while we try to establish the conditions of \\nongoing civilized society.  But I believe we\\'re going to prevail \\nthere.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, would you care to make your \\nassessment of the first 100 days before we make one for you?  \\n(Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I\\'ll say if -- I believe, first of \\nall, we passed the budget resolution in record time.  That was the \\nbiggest issue.  That confirmed the direction of the administration \\nand confirmed the commitments of the campaign that we could both \\nbring the deficit down and increase investment, and that we could do \\nit by specific spending cuts and by raising taxes, almost all of \\nwhich come from the highest income people in this society --reversing \\na 12-year trend in which most of the tax burdens were borne by the \\nmiddle class, whose incomes were going down when their taxes were \\ngoing up, while the deficit went from $1 trillion to $4 trillion, the \\ntotal national debt, and the deficit continued to go up.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     We have a 20-year low in interest rates from mortgages. \\nWe have lower interest rates across the board.  We have tens of \\nbillions of dollars flooding back into this economy as people \\nrefinance their debt.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     We have established a new environmental policy, which is \\ndramatically different.  The Secretary of Education has worked with \\nme and with others and with the governors to establish a new approach \\nin education that focuses on tough standards, as well as increasing \\nopportunity.  We have done an enormous amount of work on political \\nreform, on campaign finance and lobbying reform.  And I have imposed \\ntough ethics requirements on my own administration\\'s officials.  \\nThese things are consistent with not only what I said I\\'d do in the \\ncampaign, but with turning the country around.  The Vice President is \\nheading a task force which will literally change the way the federal \\ngovernment operates and make it much more responsive to the citizens \\nof this country.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     We are working on a whole range of other things.  The \\nwelfare reform initiative, to move people from welfare to work.  And, \\nof course, a massive amount of work has been done on the health care \\nissue, which is a huge economic and personal security problem for \\nmillions of Americans.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     So I think it is amazing how much has been done.  More \\nwill be done.  We also passed the Family Leave bill.  A version of \\nthe motor voter bill -- that has not come out of conference back to \\nme yet.  And everything has been passed except the stimulus program.  \\nSo I think we\\'re doing fine and we\\'re moving in the right direction.  \\nI feel good about it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Sir, a follow-up.  Wouldn\\'t you say, though, that \\none of your biggest initiatives, aid to Soviet Russia, is now \\npractically finished -- if we can\\'t pass a stimulus bill in our own \\ncountry, how can we do it for them?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Let me recast the question a little bit.  \\nIt\\'s a good question -- (laughter) -- it\\'s a good question, but to be \\nfair we\\'ve got to recast it.  We have already -- the first round of \\naid to the Soviet -- to non-Soviet Russia, to a democratic Russia, is \\nplainly going to go through, the first $1.6 billion.  The aid that we \\nagreed with our partners in the G-7 to provide through the \\ninternational financial institutions, which is a big dollar item, is \\nplainly going to go through.  The question is, can we get any more \\naid for Russia that requires a new appropriation by the United States \\nCongress?  And that is a question I think, Mary, that will be \\nresolved in the weeks ahead, in part by what happens to the American \\nworkers and their jobs and their future.  I think the two things will \\nbe tied by many members of Congress.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  The tailhook report came out this morning, \\ndocumenting horrendous and nearly-criminal conduct on the part of the \\nNavy.  How much did you discuss the incident and what might be done \\nabout it with your nominee to be the Secretary of the Navy?\\n\\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  First, let me comment a little on that.  \\nThe Inspector General\\'s report details conduct which is wrong and \\nwhich has no place in the armed services.  And I expect the report to \\nbe acted on in the appropriate way.  I also want to say to the \\nAmerican people and to all of you that the report should be taken for \\nwhat it is, a very disturbing list of allegations which will have to \\nbe thoroughly examined.  It should not be taken as a general \\nindictment of the United States Navy or of all the fine people who \\nserve there.  It is very specific in its allegations, and it will be \\npursued.  \\n\\n\\t     The only thing I said to the Secretary-Designate of the \\nNavy and the only thing I should have said to him, I think, is that I \\nexpected him to take the report and to do his duty.  And I believe he \\nwill do that.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, to back to Russia for just a minute.  \\nThe latest poll show that Mr. Yeltsin will probably win his vote of \\nconfidence.  But there seems to be a real toss-up on whether or not \\nvoters are going to endorse his economic reforms.  \\n\\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I understand that.  \\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  Can you live with a split -- (laughter) -- can you \\nlive with a split decision, though, or do you need both passed in \\norder to then build support for Russian aid?\\n\\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I believe -- the answer to your question \\nis, for the United States, the key question should be that which is \\nposed to any democracy, which is who wins the election.  If he wins \\nthe election, if he is ratified by the Russian people to continue as \\ntheir President, then I think we should do our best to work with him \\ntoward reform.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     You know, we had a lot of other countries here for the \\nHolocaust Museum dedication -- their leaders were here.  Leaders from \\nEastern Europe, leaders from at least one republic of the former \\nSoviet Union; all of them having terrible economic challenges as they \\nconvert from a communist command and control economy to a market \\neconomy in a world where there\\'s economic slowdown everywhere.  And \\nin a world in which there\\'s economic slowdown and difficulty, all \\nleaders will have trouble having their policies be popular in a poll \\nbecause they haven\\'t produced the results that the people so \\nearnestly yearn for.  You can understand that.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     But if they have confidence in the leadership, I think \\nthat\\'s all we can ask.  And the United States will -- if the Russian \\npeople ratify him as their President and stick with him then the \\nUnited States will continue to work with him.  I think he is a \\ngenuine democrat -- small d -- and genuinely committed to reform.  I \\nthink that we should support that.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, Mr. Perot has come out strongly in \\nwhat is perceived behind the line against a free trade agreement --\\nNAFTA.  How hard are you going to fight for this free trade agreement \\nand when do you expect to see it accomplished?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I think we\\'ll have the agreement ready \\nin the fairly near future.  You know, our people are still working \\nwith the Mexican government and with the Canadians on the side \\nagreements.  We\\'re trying to work out what the environmental \\nagreement will say, what the labor agreement will say, and then what \\nthe fairest way to deal with enforcement is.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     The Mexicans say, and there is some merit to their \\nposition, that they\\'re worried about transferring their sovereignty \\nin enforcement to a multilateral commission.  Even in the United \\nStates, to be fair, we have some folks who are worried about that --\\nabout giving that up.  On the other hand, if we\\'re going to have an \\nenvironmental agreement and a labor standards agreement that means \\nsomething, then there has to be ultimately some consequences for \\nviolating them.  So what we\\'re trying to do is to agree on an \\napproach which would say that if there is a pattern of violations --\\nif you keep on violating it past a certain point -- maybe not an \\nisolated incident, but a pattern of violation -- there is going to be \\nsome enforcement.  There must be consequences.  And we\\'re working out \\nthe details of that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     But I still feel quite good about it.  And this is just \\nan area where I disagree with Mr. Perot and with others.  I think \\nthat we will win big if we have a fair agreement that integrates more \\nclosely the Mexican economy and the American economy and leads us \\nfrom there to Chile to other market economies in Latin America, and \\ngives us a bigger world in which to trade.  I think that\\'s the only \\nway a rich country can grow richer.  If you look at what Japan and \\nother countries in the Pacific are doing to reach out in their own \\nregion, it\\'s a pretty good lesson to us that we had better worry \\nabout how to build those bridges in our own area.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     So this is an idea battle.  You know, you\\'ve got a lot \\nof questions and I want to answer them all, but let me say not every \\none of these things can be distilled simply into politics -- you \\nknow, who\\'s for this and who\\'s for that, and if this person is for \\nthis, somebody else has got to be for that.  A lot of these things \\nhonestly involved real debates over ideas, over who\\'s right and wrong \\nabout the world toward which we\\'re moving.  And the answers are not \\nself-evident.  And one of the reasons that I wanted to run for \\nPresident is I wanted to sort of open the floodgates for debating \\nthese ideas so that we could try to change in the appropriate way.  \\nSo I just have a difference of opinion.  I believe that the concept \\nof NAFTA is sound, even though, as you know, I thought that the \\ndetails needed to be improved.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, there was a tremendous flurry of \\ninterest earlier this month in the Russian document that purported to \\nshow that the Vietnamese had held back American prisoners.  General \\nVessey has now said publicly that while the document itself was \\nauthentic, he believes that it was incorrect.  Do you have a personal \\nview at this point about that issue?  And more broadly, do you \\nbelieve that, in fact, the Vietnamese did return all the American \\nprisoners at the time of the Paris Peace Accord?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  First let me say, I saw General Vessey \\nbefore he went to Vietnam and after he returned.  And I have a high \\nregard for him and I appreciate his willingness to serve his country \\nin this way.  As to whether the document had any basis in fact, let \\nme say that the government of Vietnam was more forthcoming than it \\nhad been in the past and gave us some documents that would tend to \\nundermine the validity of the Russian documents claim.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I do not know whether that is right or wrong.  We are \\nhaving it basically evaluated at this time, and when we complete the \\nevaluation, we\\'ll tell you.  And, of course, we want to tell the \\nfamilies of those who were missing in action or who were POWs.  I \\nthink that we\\'ll be able to make some progress in eliminating some of \\nthe questions about the outstanding cases as a result of this last \\ninterchange, but I cannot say that I\\'m fully satisfied that we know \\nall that we need to know.  There are still some cases that we don\\'t \\nknow the answer to.  But I do believe we\\'re making some progress.  I \\nwas encouraged by the last trip.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I\\'d like to follow up on that.  Before the U.S. \\nnormalizes relations, allows trade to go forward, do you have to be \\npersonally sure that every case has been resolved or would you be \\nwilling to go forward on the basis that while it may take years to \\nresolve these cases, the Vietnamese have made sufficient offerings to \\nus to confirm good faith?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  A lot of experts say you can never \\nresolve every case, every one, that we couldn\\'t resolve all the cases \\nfor them and that there are still some cases that have not been \\nfactually resolved, going back to the Second World War.  But what I \\nwould have to be convinced of is that we had gone a long way toward \\nresolving every case that could be resolved at this moment in time, \\nand that there was a complete, open and unrestricted commitment to \\ncontinue to do everything that could be done always to keep resolving \\nthose cases.  And we\\'re not there yet.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Again, I have to be guided a little bit by people who \\nknow a lot about this.  And I confess to being much more heavily \\ninfluenced by the families of the people whose lives were lost there, \\nor whose lives remain in question than by the commercial interest and \\nthe other things which seem so compelling in this moment.  I just am \\nvery influenced by how the families feel.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     your economic stimulus package, are you doing \\nsome kind of reality check now and scaling back some of your plans, \\nyour legislative plans for the coming year, including the crime bill, \\nthe health care initiative and other things?  Are there any plans to \\ndo that?  And also, did you underestimate the power of Senator Bob \\nDole?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  No, what I underestimated was the extent \\nto which what I thought was a fairly self-evident case, particularly \\nafter we stayed below the spending caps approved by this Congress, \\nincluding the Republicans who were in this Congress last year -- when \\nwe had already passed a budget resolution which called for over $500 \\nbillion in deficit reduction.  When they had voted repeatedly for \\nsupplemental appropriations to help foreign governments, I thought at \\nleast four of them would vote to break cloture, and I underestimated \\nthat.  I did not have an adequate strategy of dealing with that.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I also thought that if I made a good-faith effort to \\nnegotiate and to compromise, that it would not be rebuffed.  Instead, \\nevery time I offered something they reduced the offer that they had \\npreviously been talking to the Majority Leader about.  So it was a \\nstrange set of events.  But I think what happened was what was a \\nsignificant part of our plan, but not the major part of it, acquired \\na political connotation that got out of proportion to the merits, so \\nthat a lot of Republicans were saying to me privately, \"Mr. \\nPresident, I\\'d like to be for this, but I can\\'t now.  And we\\'re all \\nstrung out and we\\'re divided.\"  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     And I think we need to do a reality check.  As I said, \\nwhat I want to know -- let me go back to what I said -- what I want \\nto know from our folks and from our friends in the Senate on -- and \\nRepublicans or Democrats -- is what could I have done differently to \\nmake it come out differently.  Because the real losers here were not \\nthe President and the administration.  The real losers were the \\nhundreds of thousands of people who won\\'t have jobs now.  We could \\nhave put another 700,000 kids to work this summer.  I mean, we could \\nhave done a lot of good things with that money.  And I think that is \\nvery, very sad.  And it became more political than it should have.  \\nBut the underlying rationale I don\\'t think holds a lot of water --\\nthat it was deficit spending.  That just won\\'t wash.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     and redo --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  No.  I mean, you know, for example --you \\nmentioned the crime bill.  I think it would be a real mistake not to \\npass the crime bill.  I mean, the crime bill was almost on the point \\nof passage last year.  And they were all fighting over the Brady \\nBill.  Surely, surely after what we have been through in this country \\njust in the last three months, with the kind of mindless violence we \\nhave seen, we can pass a bill requiring people to go through a \\nwaiting period before they buy a handgun.  And surely we can see that \\nwe need more police officers on the street.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     That\\'s another thing that -- I really believe that once \\nwe move some of that money -- not all, but some of it up into this \\njobs package to make some of the jobs rehiring police officers on the \\nstreet who\\'d been laid off, that would be a compelling case.  I mean \\npeople are scared in this country and I think we need to go forward. \\nI feel very strongly that we need to go forward on the crime bill.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, back to the tailhook report for a \\nsecond.  That report contained very strong criticism of the Navy\\'s \\nsenior leadership in general, but did not name any of the senior \\nofficers.  Do you believe that the senior officers who are implicated \\nin this, including Admiral Kelso who was there one night in Las \\nVegas, should they be disciplined and do you believe the public has a \\nright to know the names of the senior officers?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  You should know that under the rules of \\nlaw which apply to this, I am in the chain of command.  There is now \\nan Inspector General\\'s report and the law must take its course.  If I \\nwere to answer that question I might prejudice any decisions which \\nmight be later made in this case.  I don\\'t really think -- I think \\nall I can tell you is what I have already said.  I was very disturbed \\nby the specific allegations in the Inspector General\\'s report, and I \\nwant appropriate action to be taken.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Until the proper procedures have a chance to kick in and \\nappropriate action is taken, I have been advised that because I am \\nthe Commander-in-Chief I have to be very careful about what I say so \\nas not to prejudice the rights of anybody against whom any action \\nmight proceed or to prejudice the case in any other way either pro or \\ncon.  So I can\\'t say any more except to say that I want this thing \\nhandled in an appropriate and thorough way.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, could I ask you for a clarification \\non Bosnia?  You said that you were not considering introduction of \\nAmerican forces.  Does that include any air forces as well as ground \\nforces, sir?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I said ground forces.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You said ground forces.  Could I ask you, sir, if \\nyou fear that using U.S. air strikes might  draw the United States \\ninto a ground war there?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I just don\\'t want to discuss our \\nevaluation of the options anymore.  I\\'ve told you that there\\'s never \\nbeen a serious discussion in this country about the introduction of \\nground forces into an ongoing conflict there.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  With hundreds of thousands of gays in Washington \\nthis weekend for the march, did you ever reconsider your decision to \\nleave town for this weekend?  Did you ever consider in any way \\nparticipating in some of the activities? \\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  No.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Why not?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Because I -- and, basically, I wouldn\\'t \\nparticipate in other marches.  I think once you become President, on \\nbalance, except under unusual circumstances, that is not what should \\nbe done.  But more importantly, I\\'m going to the American Society of \\nNewspaper Editors, a trip that presumably most of you would want me \\nto make, to try to focus anew on what I think are the fundamental \\nissues at stake for our country right now.  And I expect that I will \\nsay something about the fact that a lot of Americans have come here, \\nasking for a climate that is free of discrimination; asking, \\nbasically, to be able to work hard and live by the rules and be \\ntreated like other American citizens if they do that, and just that.  \\nAnd that\\'s always been my position -- not only for the gays who will \\nbe here, but for others as well.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Thank you very much.\\n\\n                                 END1:48 P.M.

The whole idea of an empty tomb isn't broached in any of our texts\\nuntil well after the fall of Jerusalem.  By that time, the idea of coming up\\nwith a body would have been ludicrious.

Can anybody help me out?\\n\\nThe problem is that Motif uses XGrabKey to implement menu accelerators,\\nand these grabs are specific about which modifiers apply.  Unfortunately,\\nthe specification for XGrabKey doesn\\'t allow AnyModifier to be combined\\nwith other modifiers, which is exactly what would be desired in this case:\\n\"Ctrl Any<Key>q\".\\n\\n>In ORA Vol. 6, in the section on accelerators it says \"For information\\n>on how to specify translation tables see Vol. 4...\", this is so you\\n>know what to put for the XmNaccelerator resource.

If\\nyou\\'re a Motif implementor, I\\'d suggest lobbying to get the Xlib semantics\\nchanged to support the feature I described above.  Otherwise, change the\\ndocumentation for menu accelerators to properly set the user\\'s\\nexpectations, because menu accelerators are NOT the same thing as\\ntranslations.\\n\\n>Is it possible to supply > 1 accelerator for a menu entry?\\n\\nIf you mean \"menu accelerator\", no it\\'s not possible.  That\\'s according to\\nthe definition of the XmNaccelerator resource in the XmLabel manual page.\\n\\n>Keep in mind when answering this question that when using Motif you\\n>can\\'t use XtInstallAccelerators().\\n\\nI can\\'t think of a reason why not.\\n\\n>How can you ensure that accelerators work the same independent of\\n>case?

In addition to the normal menu\\naccelerator you install on the XmPushButton[Gadget], set an XtNaccelerators\\nresource on the shell (TopLevel or Application).

To shorten development time, I\\nused TeleUSE\\'s TuNinstallAccelerators resource to install the accelerators\\non the shell, and I directly invoked the Open and Quit D actions instead\\nof asking the pushbuttons to do it for me, but the more general approach I\\ndescribed above should work.\\n\\n-- Trevor Bourget (trevor@telesoft.com)\\n',\n",

To find out more about\\n  them and how to access them, please see the \"Introduction to the\\n  news.answers newsgroup\" posting in news.answers.\\n\\n  The main FAQ archive is at rtfm.mit.edu [18.172.1.27].

Lewis (faq%craft@uunet.uu.net) maintains the informative and\\n  well written \"comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions\" document.\\n  Its focus is on general X information, while this FAQ concentrates\\n  on performance.\\n\\n  The comp.windows.x FAQ does address the issue of speed, but only with\\n  regards to the X server.  The gist of that topic seems to be:\\n\\t\"Use X11R5, it is faster than R4\".\\n  (Please see the X FAQ for complete details).\\n\\n---------------\\nWindow Managers\\n---------------\\n\\n  There are a lot of window managers out there, with lots of different\\n  features and abilities.  The choice of which to use is by necessity a\\n  balancing act between performance and useful features.  At this\\n  point, most respondents have agreed upon \"twm\" as the best candidate\\n  for a speedy window manager. \\n\\n  A couple of generic tricks you can try to soup up your window manger,\\n  is turning off unnecessary things like \"zooming\" and \"opaque move\".\\n  Also, if you lay out your windows in a tiled manner, you reduce the\\n  amount of cpu power spent in raising and lowering overlapping\\n  windows.                           Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)\\n\\n  I\\'ve found that a good font for tiling is 7x13 (aka:\\n  -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-100-100-100-c-70-iso8859-1 ). It is\\n  the biggest font I know of that I can use on my Sun (1152x900 screen)\\n  and still get two 80 column terminal windows side-by-side on the\\n  display with no overlap.  Other font suggestions will be accepted.\\n\\n------------\\nThe X Server\\n------------\\n\\nWhich Server?\\n- - - - - - -\\n  Make sure that your server is a proper match for your hardware.\\n  If you have a monochrome monitor, use a monochrome X11 server.\\n\\n  On my Monochrome Sun, I haven\\'t noticed much difference between\\n  the Xsun (colour) server and XsunMono, however it was pointed out to\\n  me that XsunMono is about 800k smaller and therefore should contribute\\n  to less paging.  \\n         [ thanks to: Jonny Farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk),\\n                        Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se) ]\\n\\n  How your server was compiled can also make a difference.  Jeff Law\\n  (law@schirf.cs.utah.edu) advises us that on a Sun system, X should be\\n  compiled with gcc (version 2.*) or with the unbundled Sun compiler.\\n  You can expect to get \"*very* large speedups in the server\" by not\\n  using the bundled SunOS compiler.  I assume that similar results\\n  would occur if you used one of the other high-quality commercial\\n  compilers on the market.\\n\\nLocking the Server into RAM?\\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\\n  Has anyone tried hacking the X server so that it is locked into RAM and\\n  does not get paged?  eg: via a call to plock().  Does this help\\n  performance at all?  I\\'ve had one inquiry on this topic, and a few\\n  pointers to the plock() function call, but no hard evidence from someone\\n  who\\'s tried it.  I am not in a position to give it a try.  \\n\\t\\t\\t  [thanks to: Eric C Claeys (ecc@eperm.att.com),\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t      Danny Backx (db@sunbim.be),\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t      Juan D. Martin (juando@cnm.us.es) ]\\nStarting your Server\\n- - - - - - - - - - -\\n  Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) :\\n    If you start up a lot of clients in your .xsession or whatever, sleep\\n    for a second or two after launching each one.  After I changed my\\n    .xclients script to do this, logging in actually took *less* time...\\n    we have a heavily loaded system without much core, though.\\n\\n  This sounds crazy, but I have confirmed that it works!  \\n\\n  Warner Losh (imp@Solbourne.COM) provided me with a good explanation of\\n  why this works, which I have summarized here:\\n\\n    When you start up an X server it takes a huge amount of time to\\n    start accepting connections.  A lot of initialization is done by\\n    the server when it starts.  This process touches a large number of\\n    pages.  Any other process running at the same time would fight the\\n    server for use of the CPU, and more importantly, memory.  If you\\n    put a sleep in there, you give the Server a chance to get itself\\n    sorted out before the clients start up.\\n\\n    Similarly, there is also a lot of initialization whenever an X\\n    client program starts: toolkits registering widgets, resources\\n    being fetched, programs initializing state and \"databases\" and so\\n    forth.  All this activity is typically memory intensive.  Once this\\n    initialization is done (\"The process has reached a steady state\"),\\n    the memory usage typically settles down to using only a few pages.\\n    By using sleeps to stagger the launching of your clients in your\\n    .Xinitrc , you avoid them fighting each other for your\\n    workstation\\'s limited resources\\n\\n  This is most definitely a \"Your Mileage May Vary\" situation, as there\\n  are so many variables to be considered: available RAM, local swap\\n  space, load average, number of users on your system, which clients\\n  you are starting, etc.\\n\\n  Currently in my .xinitrc I have a situation like:\\n\\t(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &\\n\\t(sleep 1; exec xbiff ) &\\n\\t(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &\\n\\t(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &\\n\\n  I\\'ve experimented with:\\n\\t(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &\\n\\t(sleep 2; exec xbiff ) &\\n\\t(sleep 3; exec xterm ) &\\n\\t(sleep 4; exec xterm ) &\\n\\n  I\\'ve even tried:\\n\\t(sleep 2; exec start_X_clients_script ) &\\n  and then in start_X_clients_script I had:\\n\\t(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &\\n\\t(sleep 1; exec xbiff ) &\\n\\t(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &\\n\\t(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &\\n\\n    [ The idea with this last one was to make sure that xinit had\\n    completely finished processing my .xinitrc, and had settled down\\n    into a \"steady state\" before the sleep expired and all my clients\\n    were launched. ]\\n\\n  All of these yielded fairly comparable results, and so I just stuck with\\n  my current setup, for its simplicity.  You will probably have to\\n  experiment a bit to find a setup which suits you.\\n\\nFonts\\n- - -\\n  Loading fonts takes time and RAM.  If you minimize the number of fonts\\n  your applications use, you\\'ll get speed increases in load-up time.\\n\\n  One simple strategy is to choose a small number of fonts (one small, one\\n  large, one roman, whatever suits you) and configure all your clients -- or\\n  at least all your heavily used clients -- to use only those few fonts.\\n  Client programs should start up quicker if their font is already loaded\\n  into the server.  This will also conserve server resources, since fewer\\n  fonts will be loaded by the server.\\n\\t\\t\\t      [ Farrell McKay (fbm@ptcburp.ptcbu.oz.au),\\n\\t\\t\\t        Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) ]\\n\\n  eg: My main xterm font is 7x13, so I also have twm set up to use 7x13\\n  in all it\\'s menus and icons etc.  Twm\\'s default font is 8x13.  Since\\n  I don\\'t normally use 8x13, I\\'ve eliminated one font from my server.\\n\\n  Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com):\\n    Keep fonts local to the workstation, rather than loading them over nfs.\\n    If you will make extensive use of R5 scalable fonts, use a font server.\\n\\nAbout the Resources File\\n- - - - - - - - - - - - -\\n\\n    Keep your .Xresources / .Xdefaults file small.  Saves RAM and saves\\n    on server startup time.          Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)\\n\\n  One suggestion:\\n\\n    In your .Xdefaults (.Xresources) file, try putting only the minimum\\n    number of resources that you want to have available to all of your\\n    applications.  For example:  *reverseVideo: true\\n\\n    Then, separate your resources into individual client-specific\\n    resource files.  For example: $HOME/lib/app-defaults.  In your\\n    .login file set the environment variable XUSERFILESEARCHPATH:\\n\\n\\tsetenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH $HOME/lib/app-defaults/%N\\n\\n    [ The \"comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions\" FAQ contains\\n    an excellent explanation of how these environment variables work.\\n    --ed.]\\n\\n    So, when xterm launches, it loads its resources from\\n    .../app-defaults/XTerm.  Xdvi finds them in .../app-defaults/XDvi,\\n    and so on and so forth.  Note that not all clients follow the same\\n    XXxxx resource-file naming pattern.  You can check in your system\\n    app-defaults directory (often: /usr/X11R5/lib/X11/app-defaults/) to\\n    find the proper name, and then name your personal resource files\\n    with the same name.\\n\\n    This is all documented in the Xt Specification (pg 125 & 666).\\n\\t\\t    [Thanks to: Kevin Samborn (samborn@mtkgc.com),\\n\\t\\t         Michael Urban (urban@cobra.jpl.nasa.gov),\\n\\t\\t             and Mike Long (mikel@ee.cornell.edu).\\n\\t     Kevin is willing mail his setup files to inquirers.]\\n\\n  This method of organizing your personal resources has the following\\n  benefits:\\n\\n    - Easier to maintain / more usable.\\n\\n    - Fewer resources are stored in the X server in the RESOURCE_MANAGER\\n      property.  As a side benefit your server may start fractionally\\n      quicker, since it doesn`t have to load all your resources.\\n\\n    - Applications only process their own resources, never have to sort \\n      through all of your resources to find the ones that affect them.\\n\\n  It also has drawbacks:\\n\\n    - the application that you are interested in has to load an\\n      additional file every time it starts up.  This doesn\\'t seem to\\n      make that much of a performance difference, and you might\\n      consider this a huge boon to usability.  If you are modifying an\\n      application\\'s resource database, you just need to re-run the\\n      application without having to \"xrdb\" again.\\n\\n    - xrdb will by default run your .Xdefaults file through cpp.  When\\n      your resources are split out into multiple resource files and\\n      then loaded by the individual client programs, they will not.\\n      WATCH OUT FOR THIS!!\\n\\n      I had C style comments in my .Xdefaults file, which cpp stripped\\n      out.  When I switched to this method of distributed resource\\n      files I spent several frustrating days trying to figure out why\\n      my clients were not finding their resources.  Xt did *NOT*\\n      provide any error message when it encountered the C style\\n      comments in the resource files, it simply, silently, aborted\\n      processing the resource file.\\n\\n      The loss of preprocessing (which can be very handy, e.g. ``#ifdef\\n      COLOR\\'\\' ...) is enough to cause some people to dismiss this\\n      method of resource management.\\n\\n    - You may also run into some clients which break the rules.  For\\n      example, neither Emacs (18.58.3) nor Xvt (1.0) will find their\\n      resources if they are anywhere other than in .Xdefaults.\\n\\n    - when starting up a client on a machine that does not share files\\n      with the machine where your resources are stored, your client\\n      will not find its resources.  Loading all your resources into the\\n      server will guarantee that all of your clients will always find\\n      their resources.            Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov)\\n\\n  A possible compromise suggestion that I have (and am planning on trying)\\n  is to put resources for all my heavily used clients (eg: xterm) into my\\n  .Xdefaults file, and to use the \"separate resources files\" method for\\n  clients that I seldom use.\\n\\nDefine Your Display Properly\\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\\n\\n  Client programs are often executed on the same machine as the server.  In\\n  that situation, rather than setting your DISPLAY environment variable to \\n  \"<hostname>:0.0\", where <hostname> is the name of your workstation, you\\n  should set your DISPLAY variable to \"unix:0.0\" or \":0.0\".  By doing this\\n  you access optimized routines that know that the server is on the same\\n  machine and use a shared memory method of transferring requests.\\n\\t\\t\\t[thanks to Patrick J Horgan (pjh70@ras.amdahl.com)]\\n\\n  See the _DISPLAY NAMES_ section of the X(1) man page for further\\n  explanation of how to properly set your display name.\\n\\n  \"I don\\'t think it\\'s stock MIT, but (at least) Data General and HP have\\n  libraries that are smart enough to use local communication even when\\n  the DISPLAY isn\\'t set specially.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t      Rob Sartin (88opensi!sartin@uunet.UU.NET)\\n\\n  [Jody Goldberg (jody@algorithmics.com) sent me an Xlib patch to change\\n  stock R5 to use local communication even if DISPLAY is not properly set.\\n  I don\\'t want to get in the business of distributing or trying to juggle\\n  non-MIT patches and so have elected not to include it here.

Some advocate the use of programs that are\\n  strictly Xlib based, since Xt, Xaw and other toolkits are rather\\n  large.  Others warn us that other applications which you are using\\n  may have already loaded up one or more of these shared libraries.  In\\n  this case, using a non-Xt (for example) client program may actually\\n  _increase_ the amount of RAM consumed.\\n\\n  The upshot of all this seems to be: Don\\'t mix toolkits.  That is, try\\n  and use just Athena clients, or just Xview clients (or just Motif\\n  clients, etc).  If you use more than one, then you\\'re dragging in\\n  more than one toolkit library.\\n\\n  Know your environment, and think carefully about which client\\n  programs would work best together in that environment.\\n\\n\\t\\t  [Thanks to: Rob Sartin (88opensi!sartin@uunet.UU.NET),\\n      Duncan Sinclair (sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk | sinclair@uk.ac.gla.dcs) ]\\n\\nA Better Clock for X\\n- - - - - - - - - - -\\n\\n1) xcuckoo\\n   suggested by: Duncan Sinclair (sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk)\\n   available: on export.lcs.mit.edu\\n\\n   Xcuckoo displays a clock in the title bar of *another* program.\\n   Saves screen real estate.\\n\\n2) mclock\\n   suggested by: der Mouse (mouse@Lightning.McRCIM.McGill.EDU)\\n   available: larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (132.206.1.1) in /X/mclock.shar\\n\\n   Non Xt-based.

Examining the what was\\n    going on with xscope I found it.  It seems that when the resource\\n    XmNblinkRate is non-zero and the focus is on a text field widget\\n    (or even just a text widget) the I-beam cursor will blink.\\n    Every time the cursor appears or disappears in those widgets, the\\n    widget code is making a request to the server (CopyArea).  The user\\n    can stop this by setting the resource XmNblinkRate to 0.  It is not\\n    noticeable on a 40MHz SPARC, but it does make a little difference\\n    on a [slower system].\\n\\n  This specific suggestion can probably be applied in general to lots\\n  of areas.  Consider your heavily used clients, are there any minor\\n  embellishments that can be turned off and thereby save on Server\\n  requests?\\n\\n-------------------------\\nMiscellaneous Suggestions\\n-------------------------\\n\\nPretty Pictures\\n- - - - - - - -\\n  Don\\'t use large bitmaps (GIF\\'s, etc) as root window backgrounds.\\n\\n  - The more complicated your root window bitmap, the slower the server\\n    is at redrawing your screen when you reposition windows (or redraw, etc)\\n\\n  - These take up RAM, and CPU power.  I work on a Sun SPARC and I\\'m\\n    conscious of performance issues, I can\\'t comprehend it when I see\\n    people with a 4mb Sun 3/60 running xphoon as their root window.\\n\\n    I\\'ll let someone else figure out how much RAM would be occupied by\\n    having a full screen root image on a colour workstation.\\n\\n  - If you\\'re anything like me, you need all the screen real estate\\n    that you can get for clients, and so rarely see the root window anyway.\\n\\n\\t\\t      [ Thanks to Qiang Alex Zhao (azhao@cs.arizona.edu) \\n\\t\\t\\tfor reminding me of this one. --ed.]\\n\\nA Quicker Mouse\\n- - - - - - - -\\n  Using xset, you can adjust how fast your pointer moves on the screen\\n  when you move your mouse.

See the xset man page for further ideas and information.\\n\\n  Hint: sometimes you may want to *slow down* your mouse tracking for\\n  fine work.

Some that stick out:\\n\\n    - For Motif programs, don\\'t set XmFontList resources for individual\\n      buttons, labels, lists, et. al.; use the defaultFontList or\\n      labelFontList or whatever resource of the highest-level manager\\n      widget.  Again, stick to as few fonts as possible.\\n\\n    - Better yet, don\\'t use Motif at all.  It\\'s an absolute pig.\\n\\n    - Don\\'t create and destroy widgets on the fly.  Try to reuse them.\\n      (This will avoid many problems with buggy toolkits, too.)\\n\\n    - Use a line width of 0 in GCs.  On some servers this makes a HUGE\\n      difference.\\n\\n    - Compress and collapse multiple Expose events.  This can make the\\n      difference between a fast application and a completely unusable\\n      one.\\n\\n  Francois Staes (frans@kiwi.uia.ac.be) :\\n    Just a small remark: I once heard that using a better malloc\\n    function would greatly increase performance of Xt based\\n    applications since they use malloc heavily. They suggested trying\\n    out the GNUY malloc, but I didn\\'t find the time yet. I did some\\n    tests on small programs just doing malloc and free, and the\\n    differences were indeed very noticeable ( somewhat 5 times faster)\\n\\n  [ Any confirmation on this from anyone?  --ed.]\\n\\n  Andre\\' Beck (Andre_Beck@IRS.Inf.TU-Dresden.de) :\\n\\n  - Unnecessary NoExpose Events.\\n\\n    Most people use XCopyArea/XCopyPlane as fastest blit routines, but\\n    they forget to reset graphics_exposures in the GC used for the\\n    blits. This will cause a NoExpose Event every blit, that, in most\\n    cases, only puts load onto the connection and forces the client to\\n    run through it\\'s event-loop again and again.\\n\\n  - Thousands of XChangeGC requests.\\n\\n    This \"Gfx Context Switching\" is also seen in most handcoded X-Apps,\\n    where only one or few GCs are created and then heavily changed\\n    again and again.  Xt uses a definitely better mechanism, by caching\\n    and sharing a lot of GCs with all needed parameters. This will\\n    remove the load of subsequent XChangeGC requests from the\\n    connection (by moving it toward the client startup phase).\\n\\nSay What!?\\n- - - - - - \\n  Some contributors proposed ideas that seem right off the wall at first:\\n\\n  David B. Lewis (by day: dbl@osf.org, by night: david%craft@uunet.uu.net) :\\n    How about this: swap displays with someone else. Run all your programs\\n    on the other machine and display locally; the other user runs off your\\n    machine onto the other display.

Not really a\\n    major problem, except that the X11 client and the server are in\\n    absolute synchronicity and are context thrashing.\\n\\n  Timothy H Panton (thp@westhawk.uucp) :\\n    Firstly it relies on the fact that most CPU\\'s are mostly idle, X\\'s\\n    cpu usage is bursty.  so the chances of you and your teammate\\n    doing something cpu-intensive at the same time is small. If they\\n    are not then you get twice the cpu+memory available for your\\n    action.\\n\\n    The second factor is that context switches are expensive, using 2\\n    cpu\\'s halves them, you pay a price due to the overhead of going\\n    over the network, but this is offset in most cases by the improved\\n    buffering of a network (typically 20k vs 4k for a pipe), allowing\\n    even fewer context switches.\\n\\n----------------------------\\nOther Sources of Information\\n----------------------------\\n\\n  Volume 8 in O\\'Reilly\\'s X Window System Series, ``X Window System\\n  Administrator\\'s Guide\\'\\' is a book all X administrator\\'s should read.\\n\\n  Adrian Nye (adrian@ora.com):\\n    A lot more tips on performance are in the paper \"Improving X\\n    Application Performance\" by Chris D.

There\\nwas little involvement of federal funds, or except through support of\\nstate universities, of state funds, for scientific research before WWII.\\nThe US research position had been growing steadily, and the funding was\\nmainly from university and private foundation funds.  There were not that\\nmany research universities, but they all provided their researchers with\\nlow teaching loads, laboratories, assistants, and equipment, and funds for\\ntravel to scientific meetings.  Not that much, but it was provided, and a\\nuniversity wishing to get a scholar had to consider research funding as well\\nas salary.\\n\\nDuring WWII, the military and the defense departments found that pure\\nscientists could do quite well with their problems, even though they \\nwere not exactly in the areas of the scientists\\' expertise.  This is\\nprobably because of the \"research mind\" approach, which is not to try\\nto find a solution, but to understand the problem and see if a solution\\nemerges.  This works in stages, and as research scientists were used to\\ndiscussion about their problems, the job got done.\\n\\nThe military realized the importance of maintaining scientists for the\\nfuture, and started funding pure research after WWII.  But Congress was\\nunwilling to have military funds diverted into this investment into the\\nfuture supply of scientists, and set up other organizations, such as \\nNSF, to do the job.  It also set up an elaborate procedure to supposedly\\nkeep politics out.  Also, the government did a job on private foundations,\\nmaking it more difficult for them to act to support research.\\n\\nThe worst part of the federal involvement is that in those areas in which\\nthe government supports research the university will not provide funding,\\nand in fact expects its scholars to bring in net government money.  Suppose,\\nas has been the case, I have a project which could use the assistance of\\na graduate student for a few months.  What do you think happens if I ask\\nfor one?  The answer I will get is, \"Get the money from NSF.\"  Now the\\nmoney at the university level is a few thousand, but at the NSF level it\\ncomes to about 20 thousand, and is likely to keep a faculty member from\\ngetting supported.  So the government is, in effect, deciding which projects\\nget supported, and how much.  \\n\\nAlso, the government decided that the \"wealth\" should be spread.  So instead\\nof having a moderate number of universities which were primarily research\\ninstitutions, the idea that more schools should get into the act came into\\nbeing.  And instead of evaluating scholars, they had to go to evaluating\\nreseach proposals.  As a researcher, I can tell you that any research proposal\\nhas to be mainly wishful thinking, or as now happens, the investigator conceals\\nalready done work to release it as the results of the research.  What I am\\nproposing today I may solve before the funding is granted, I may find \\nimpossible, or I may find that it is too difficult.

An EFF Statement\\nX-Xxmessage-Id: <A7F49385AC03AC80@harding.eff.org>\\nX-Xxdate: Fri, 16 Apr 93 21:47:01 GMT\\nNntp-Posting-Host: harding.eff.org\\nOrganization: Electronic Frontier Foundation\\nX-Useragent: Nuntius v1.1.1d17\\nLines: 122\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nApril 16, 1993\\n\\nINITIAL EFF ANALYSIS OF CLINTON PRIVACY AND SECURITY PROPOSAL\\n\\nThe Clinton Administration today made a major announcement on\\ncryptography policy which will effect the privacy and security of\\nmillions of Americans.  The first part of the plan is to begin a\\ncomprehensive inquiry into major communications privacy issues such as\\nexport controls which have effectively denied most people easy access to\\nrobust encryption, and law enforcement issues posed by new technology.\\n\\nHowever, EFF is very concerned that the Administration has already\\nreached a conclusion on one critical part of the inquiry, before any\\npublic comment or discussion has been allowed.  Apparently, the\\nAdministration is going to use its leverage to get all telephone\\nequipment vendors to adopt a voice encryption standard developed by the\\nNational Security Agency.  The so-called \"Clipper Chip\" is an 80-bit,\\nsplit key escrowed encryption scheme which will be built into chips\\nmanufactured by a military contractor.  Two separate escrow agents would\\nstore users\\' keys, and be required to turn them over law enforcement upon\\npresentation of a valid warrant.  The encryption scheme used is to be\\nclassified, but the chips will be available to any manufacturer for\\nincorporation into its communications products.\\n\\n     This proposal raises a number of serious concerns .\\n\\nFirst, the Administration has adopted a solution before conducting an\\ninquiry.  The NSA-developed Clipper Chip may not be the most secure\\nproduct. Other vendors or developers may have better schemes.\\nFurthermore, we should not rely on the government as the sole source for\\nthe Clipper or any other chips.  Rather, independent chip manufacturers\\nshould be able to produce chipsets based on open standards.\\n\\nSecond, an algorithm cannot be trusted unless it can be tested. Yet, the\\nAdministration proposes to keep the chip algorithm classified.  EFF\\nbelieves that any standard adopted ought to be public and open.  The\\npublic will only have confidence in the security of a standard that is\\nopen to independent, expert scrutiny.  \\n\\nThird, while the use of the use of a split-key, dual escrowed system may\\nprove to be a reasonable balance between privacy and law enforcement\\nneeds, the details of this scheme must be explored publicly before it is\\nadopted.  What will give people confidence in the safety of their keys? \\nDoes disclosure of keys to a third party waive an individual\\'s Fifth\\nAmendment rights in subsequent criminal inquiries?  These are but a few\\nof the many questions the Administrations proposal raised but fails to\\nanswer.\\n\\nIn sum, the Administration has shown great sensitivity to the importance\\nof these issues by planning a comprehensive inquiry into digital privacy\\nand security.  However, the \"Clipper Chip\" solution ought to be\\nconsidered as part of the inquiry, and not be adopted before the\\ndiscussion even begins.\\n\\nDETAILS OF THE PROPOSAL:\\n\\nESCROW\\n\\nThe 80-bit key will be divided between two escrow agents, each of whom\\nhold 40-bits of each key.  The manufacturer of the communications device\\nwould be required to register all keys with the two independent escrow\\nagents.  A key is tied to the device, however, not the person using it.\\n\\nUpon presentation of a valid court order, the two escrow agents would\\nhave to turn the key parts over to law enforcement agents.  According to\\nthe Presidential Directive just issued, the Attorney General will be\\nasked to identify appropriate escrow agents.  Some in the Administration\\nhave suggested that one non-law enforcement federal agency (perhaps the\\nFederal Reserve), and one non-governmental organization could be chosen,\\nbut there is no agreement on the identity of the agents yet.\\n\\nCLASSIFIED ALGORITHM AND THE POSSIBILITY OF BACK DOORS\\n\\nThe Administration claims that there are no back doors -- means by which\\nthe government or others could break the code without securing keys from\\nthe escrow agents -- and that the President will be told there are no\\nback doors to this classified algorithm.  In order to prove this,\\nAdministration sources are interested in arranging for an all-star crypto\\ncracker team to come in, under a security arrangement, and examine the\\nalgorithm for trap doors.  The results of the investigation would then be\\nmade public.\\n\\nThe Clipper Chipset was designed and is being produced and a sole-source,\\nsecret contract between the National Security Agency and two private\\nfirms:  VLSI and Mycotronx.  NSA work on this plan has been underway for\\nabout four years.  The manufacturing contract was let 14 months ago.\\n\\nGOVERNMENT AS MARKET DRIVER\\n\\nIn order to get a market moving, and to show that the government believes\\nin the security of this system, the feds will be the first big customers\\nfor this product.  Users will include the FBI, Secret Service, VP Al\\nGore, and maybe even the President.  At today\\'s Commerce Department press\\nbriefing, a number of people asked this question, though:  why would any\\nprivate organization or individual adopt a classified standard that had\\nno independent guaranty of security or freedom from trap doors?\\n\\nCOMPREHENSIVE POLICY INQUIRY\\n\\nThe Administration has also announced that it is about to commence an\\ninquiry into all policy issues related to privacy protection, encryption,\\nand law enforcement.  The items to be considered include:  export\\ncontrols on encryption technology and the FBI\\'s Digital Telephony\\nProposal.  It appears that the this inquiry will be conducted by the\\nNational Security Council.  Unfortunately, however, the Presidential\\nDirective describing the inquiry is classified.  Some public involvement\\nin the process has been promised, but they terms have yet to be specified.\\n\\nFROM MORE INFORMATION CONTACT:\\n\\nJerry Berman, Executive Director (jberman@eff.org)\\nDaniel J.

Some magazines also provide the data on\\nself-adhesive labels, and the really big magazines provide the\\ndata on computer disk.\\n\\nThe advertiser decides what to do with the data they get. You will\\nnotice that the Radio Electronics information card (commonly called\\na \"bingo card\" in the industry) includes lines for a company name\\nand a business phone number. My guess would be that the big, national\\nadvertisers make a distinction between hobbiests and professionals as\\nbest they can. For example, if you include Motorola as your company\\nand include a business phone (and a mail stop), Tektronics will probably\\nsend you a copy of their hard-bound catalog and have a sales engineer\\ncall you about a week later. If you leave it blank, odds are they\\nwill send you a slick brochure and direct you to a local retail\\noutlet. Medium and small companies are more likely to send you th\\ne whole catalog. And then some companies, like Digikey or Jameco, have\\nnothing to mail out accept the catalog.\\n\\nA couple of other interesting points about bingo cards: Free, industry\\nmagazines like EDN and such also log your card to their computer. They\\nuse the information at least three ways. They note that you really do read\\nthe magazine and are more likely to continue your subscription or push\\nyou, through repeated mailings, to re-subscribe. They also compile\\nhow many people requested which data for their marketing demographics.\\nThis way thay can tell a prospective advertiser that \"23% of readers\\nrequesting data were interested in capacitors.\" And finally, some\\nmagazines rent lists of readers who request certain information. For\\nexample, Tektronics can rent a list of everyone who requested information\\nabout test equipment OTHER THAN TEKTRONIC\\'s, in the past 6 months.\\n\\nThe other point, in the data the advertiser receives, many magazines\\ninclude how many items you circled on the card. If they want, the\\nadvertiser can attempt to cull out the \"literature collectors\" from\\nthe serious potential customers.\\n\\n\"Can you say qualified sales leads? I thought you could.\"\\n\\nWhat\\'s the BEST way for a hobbiest to deal with bingo cards?\\n\\n  Never circle more than 8 number on the card. If you want more\\n  than 8 items, use the second card and mail it a couple of\\n  weeks later.\\n\\n  If you are really, really serious and you really, really want\\n  the information, CALL THE ADVERTISER AND ASK! This will also\\n  cut about 15 days off the the response time. Virtually\\n  everyone takes a voice on the phone more seriously than data\\n  on a computer printout.\\n\\n  To help insure you keep getting a trade magazine that you\\'re\\n  not really \"qualified\" for, send in a bingo card at least every\\n  other month and circle two or three numbers.\\n\\n  Include a business name and phone number, even if it\\'s your house.\\n  Advertisers almost never call. \\n\\nJohn Schuch\\n  publisher of: The Arizona High-Tech Times\\n                The Arizona Electrical Journal\\n                The Arizona HVAC News\\n  (all of which have bingo cards)\\n\\n\\n',\n",

I realize it is \\n> normally tossed out because it contains miracles, but what\\n> are the other reasons?\\n\\nFar from being \"tossed out,\" the gospels are taken, almost\\nuniversally, as the primary source of information about Jesus.\\nI am curious as to whom Mike Cobb is referring.  Who \"tosses out\"\\nthe New Testament?  Undoubtedly a few *naive* atheists do this,\\nbut the phrasing of the question above seems to suggest that Cobb\\nascribes this more broadly.\\n\\nPerhaps the question that gets more to the heart of the matter is\\nwhy, except for some *naive* believers (who, unfortunately, far\\noutnumber nonbelievers, both naive and critical), are the gospels\\n*not* taken as \"gospel truth\" that faithfully records just what\\nhappened two thousand years ago?  This has an easy answer, and\\nthe answer has *nothing* to do with miracles: no text is taken\\nthis way by a critical reader.\\n\\nThere is a myth among some naive believers that one takes a text,\\nmeasures it by some set of criteria, and then either confirms the\\ntext as \"historically valid\" or \"tosses out\" the text.  I suspect\\nthis myth comes from the way history is presented in primary and\\nsecondary school, where certain texts are vested with authority,\\nand from writers such as Josh McDowell who pretend to present\\nhistorical arguments along these lines for their religious\\nprogram.  In fact, most texts used in primary and secondary\\nschool history classes ought to be tossed out, even the better\\nsuch texts should not be treated as authoritatively as descibed\\nabove, and Josh McDowell would not know a historical argument if\\nit bit him on the keister twice.\\n\\nLet me present the barest outlines of a different view of texts\\nand their use in studying history.  First, all texts are\\nhistorically valid.  ALL texts.  Or to put this another way, I\\nhave never seen a notion of \"historical validity\" that makes any\\nsense when applied to a text.  Second, no text should be read as\\ntelling the \"gospel truth\" about historical events, in the way\\nthat many students are wont to read history texts in primary and\\nsecondary school.  NO text.  (This includes your favorite\\nauthor\\'s history of whatever.)\\n\\nEvery text is a historical fact.  Every text was written by some\\nperson (or some group of people) for some purpose.  Hence, every\\ntext can serve as historical evidence.  The question is: what can\\nwe learn from a text?  Of what interesting things (if any) does\\nthe text provide evidence?\\n\\nThe diaries of the followers of the Maharishi, formerly of\\nOregon, are historical evidence.  The gospels are historical\\nevidence.  The letters of the officers who participated in the \\nvampire inquests in Eastern Europe are historical evidence.  The\\nmodern American history textbooks that whitewash \"great American\\nfigures\" are historical evidence.  These are all historical\\nevidence of various things.  They are *not* much evidence at all\\nthat the Maharishi, formerly of Oregon, could levitate; that\\nJesus was resurrected; that vampires exist; or that \"great\\nAmerican figures\" are as squeaky clean as we learned in school.\\nThey are better evidence that some people \"saw\" the Maharishi,\\nlate of Oregon, levitate; that some of the early Christians\\nthought Jesus was resurrected; that many people in Eastern Europe\\n\"saw\" vampires return from the grave; and that we still have an\\neducational system that largely prefers to spread myth rather\\nthan teach history.\\n\\nHow does one draw causal connections and infer what a piece of\\nhistorical evidence -- text or otherwise -- evinces?  This is a\\nvery complex question that has no easily summarized answer.\\nThere are many books on the subject or various parts of the\\nsubject.  I enjoy David Hackett Fischer\\'s \"Historian\\'s Fallacies\"\\nas a good antidote to the uncritical way in which it is so easy\\nto read texts present history.  It\\'s relatively cheap.  It\\'s easy\\nto read.  Give it a try.\\n\\nRussell\\n\\n',\n",

In their names we demand justice.\\n\\nIn April 1915, the Turkish government began a systematically executed \\nde-population of the eastern Anatolian homeland of the Armenians through a \\ngenocidal extermination. This genocide was to insure that Turks exclusively\\nruled over the geographic area today called the Republic of Turkey. The \\nresult: 1.5 million murdered, 30 billion dollars of Armenian property stolen\\nand plundered. This genocide ended nearly 3,000 years of Armenian civilization\\non those lands. Today, the Turkish government continues to scrape clean any\\nvestige of a prior Armenian existence on those lands. Today\\'s Turkish\\ngovernmental policy is to re-write the history of the era, to manufacture\\ndistortion and generate excuses for their genocide of the Armenian people. In \\nthe face of refutation ad nauseam, the Turkish Historical Society and cronies \\nshamelessly continue to deny that any such genocide occurred. This policy \\nmerely demonstrates that in the modern era, genocide is an effective state \\npolicy when it remains un-redressed and un-punished. A crime unpunished is a \\ncrime encouraged. Adolf Hitler took this cue less than 25 years after the \\nsuccessful genocide of the Armenians.\\n\\nTurkey claims there was no systematic deportation of Armenians, yet...\\nArmenians were removed from every city, town, and village in the whole of \\nTurkey! Armenians who resisted deportation and massacre are referred to as \\n\"rebels\".\\n\\nTurkey claims there was no genocide of the Armenians, yet...Turkish population\\nfigures today show zero Armenians in eastern Turkey, the Armenian homeland.\\n\\nTurkey claims Armenians were always a small minority, yet...Turkey claims \\nArmenians were a \"threat\".\\n\\nIn a final insult to the victims, the Republic of Turkey sold the bones of \\napproximately 100,000 murdered Armenians for profit to Europe.\\n\\nToday, the Turkish government is enjoying the fruits of that genocide. The\\nsuccess of this genocide is hangs over the heads of Turkey\\'s Kurdish\\npopulation.\\n\\nThe Armenians demand recognition, reparation, return of Armenian land and\\nproperty lost as a result of this genocide.\\n\\nARMENIANS DEMAND JUSTICE                              ERMENILER ADALET ISTIYOR\\n\\n\\n-- \\nDavid Davidian dbd@urartu.sdpa.org   | \"Armenia has not learned a lesson in\\nS.D.P.A.

My voice is coming to\\nyou this morning through the facilities of the oldest radio\\nstation in America, KDKA in Pittsburgh.  I'm visiting the city to\\nmeet personally with citizens here to discuss my plans for jobs,\\nhealth care and the economy.  But I wanted first to do my weekly\\nbroadcast with the American people. \\n             \\n             I'm told this station first broadcast in 1920 when\\nit reported that year's presidential elections.  Over the past\\nseven decades presidents have found ways to keep in touch with\\nthe people, from whistle-stop tours to fire-side chats to the bus\\ntour that I adopted, along with Vice President Gore, in last\\nyear's campaign.\\n             \\n             Every Saturday morning I take this time to talk with\\nyou, my fellow Americans, about the problems on your minds and\\nwhat I'm doing to try and solve them.  It's my way of reporting\\nto you and of giving you a way to hold me accountable.\\n             \\n             You sent me to Washington to get our government and\\neconomy moving after years of paralysis and policy and a bad\\nexperiment with trickle-down economics.  You know how important\\nit is for us to make bold, comprehensive changes in the way we do\\nbusiness.  \\n             \\n             We live in a competitive global economy.  Nations\\nrise and fall on the skills of their workers, the competitiveness\\nof their companies, the imagination of their industries, and the\\ncooperative experience and spirit that exists between business,\\nlabor and government.  Although many of the economies of the\\nindustrialized world are now suffering from slow growth, they've\\nmade many of the smart investments and the tough choices which\\nour government has for too long ignored.  That's why many of them\\nhave been moving ahead and too many of our people have been\\nfalling behind.\\n             \\n             We have an economy today that even when it grows is\\nnot producing new jobs.  We've increased the debt of our nation\\nby four times over the last 12 years, and we don't have much to\\nshow for it.  We know that wages of most working people have\\nstopped rising, that most people are working longer work weeks\\nand that too many families can no longer afford the escalating\\ncost of health care.\\n             \\n             But we also know that, given the right tools, the\\nright incentives and the right encouragement, our workers and\\nbusinesses can make the kinds of products and profits our economy\\nneeds to expand opportunity and to make our communities better\\nplaces to live.\\n             \\n             In many critical products today Americans are the\\nlow cost, high quality producers.  Our task is to make sure that\\nwe create more of those kinds of jobs.\\n             \\n             Just two months ago I gave Congress my plan for\\nlong-term jobs and economic growth.  It changes the old\\npriorities in Washington and puts our emphasis where it needs to\\nbe -- on people's real needs, on increasing investments and jobs\\nand education, on cutting the federal deficit, on stopping the\\nwaste which pays no dividends, and redirecting our precious\\nresources toward investment that creates jobs now and lays the\\ngroundwork for robust economic growth in the future.\\n             \\n             These new directions passed the Congress in record\\ntime and created a new sense of hope and opportunity in our\\ncountry.  Then the jobs plan I presented to Congress, which would\\ncreate hundreds of thousands of jobs, most of them in the private\\nsector in 1993 and 1994, passed the House of Representatives.  It\\nnow has the support of a majority of the United States Senate. \\nBut it's been held up by a filibuster of a minority in the\\nSenate, just 43 senators.  They blocked a vote that they know\\nwould result in the passage of our bill and the creation of jobs.\\n             \\n             The issue isn't politics; the issue is people. \\nMillions of Americans are waiting for this legislation and\\ncounting on it, counting on us in Washington.  But the jobs bill\\nhas been grounded by gridlock.  \\n             \\n             I know the American people are tired of business as\\nusual and politics as usual.  I know they don't want us to spin\\nor wheels.  They want the recovery to get moving.  So I have\\ntaken a first step to break this gridlock and gone the extra\\nmile.  Yesterday I offered to cut the size of this plan by 25\\npercent -- from $16 billion to $12 billion.  \\n             \\n             It's not what I'd hoped for.  With 16 million\\nAmericans looking for full-time work, I simply can't let the bill\\nlanguish when I know that even a compromise bill will mean\\nhundreds of thousands of jobs for our people.  The mandate is to\\nact to achieve change and move the country forward.  By taking\\nthis initiative in the face of an unrelenting Senate talkathon, I\\nthink we can respond to your mandate and achieve a significant\\nportion of our original goals.\\n             \\n             First, we want to keep the programs as much as\\npossible that are needed to generate jobs and meet human needs,\\nincluding highway and road construction, summer jobs for young\\npeople, immunization for children, construction of waste water\\nsites, and aid to small businesses.  We also want to keep funding\\nfor extended unemployment compensation benefits, for people who\\nhave been unemployed for a long time because the economy isn't\\ncreating jobs.\\n             \\n             Second, I've recommended that all the other programs\\nin the bill be cut across-the-board by a little more than 40\\npercent.\\n             \\n             And third, I've recommended a new element in this\\nprogram to help us immediately start our attempt to fight against\\ncrime by providing $200 million for cities and towns to rehire\\npolice officers who lost their jobs during the recession and put\\nthem back to work protecting our people.  I'm also going to fight\\nfor a tough crime bill because the people of this country need it\\nand deserve it.\\n             \\n             Now, the people who are filibustering this bill --\\nthe Republican senators -- say they won't vote for it because it\\nincreases deficit spending, because there's extra spending this\\nyear that hasn't already been approved.  That sounds reasonable,\\ndoesn't it?  Here's what they don't say.  This program is more\\nthan paid for by budget cuts over my five-year budget, and this\\nbudget is well within the spending limits already approved by the\\nCongress this year.\\n             \\n             It's amazing to me that many of these same senators\\nwho are filibustering the bill voted during the previous\\nadministration for billions of dollars of the same kind of\\nemergency spending, and much of it was not designed to put the\\nAmerican people to work.  \\n             \\n             This is not about deficit spending.  We have offered\\na plan to cut the deficit.  This is about where your priorities\\nare -- on people or on politics.  \\n             \\n             Keep in mind that our jobs bill is paid for dollar\\nfor dollar.  It is paid for by budget cuts.  And it's the\\nsoundest investment we can now make for ourselves and our\\nchildren.  I urge all Americans to take another look at this jobs\\nand investment program; to consider again the benefits for all of\\nus when we've helped make more American partners working to\\nensure the future of our nation and the strength of our economy.\\n             \\n             You know, if every American who wanted a job had\\none, we wouldn't have a lot of the other problems we have in this\\ncountry today.  This bill is not a miracle, it's a modest first\\nstep to try to set off a job creation explosion in this country\\nagain.  But it's a step we ought to take.  And it is fully paid\\nfor over the life of our budget.\\n             \\n             Tell your lawmakers what you think.  Tell them how\\nimportant the bill is.  If it passes, we'll all be winners.\\n             \\n             Good morning, and thank you for listening.\\n\\n                               END                 10:11 A.M. EDT\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

Drugs are very illegal and they\\'re\\nhere.  For years Canada has crowed about its gun control.  If it is\\nnecessary to control guns over the whole continent, then Canada should\\nhave always had comparable rates to the U.S., yet they still don\\'t.\\nUnless you can tell me why the Canadian border is so much more\\nmagical than the Mexican border (which is shorter and far more\\nheavily patrolled) then I really can\\'t accept that argument.\\n\\n>Mixing weapons and things that can be use as one:\\n>What I meant was that cars CAN kill, but they are not GUNS!\\n\\n       No, there are approximately 31,000 deaths due to guns in the U.S.,\\ntwo-thirds of which are suicides.  (Unfortunately I don\\'t have suicide\\nrates for Norway.)  However, this makes the per-gun death rate about\\nhalf the per-car death rate.\\n\\n>The issue (I hope..):\\n>I think we all agree that the criminals are the main problem.\\n>Guns are not a problem, but the way they are used is....

The\\nfct of the matter is simply this:  If nobody ever assaulted anybody,\\nwhether there is a weapon of any sort around would be totally\\nirrelevent.\\n\\n      Yet weapons are *built*.  I\\'d suggest, then, that the murderous\\nimpulse in humanity pre-dates weapons.\\n\\n      Anyway, the Bosnians et al. have been making an excellent attempt\\nto kill each other for half a thousand years.  Taking away their guns, even\\nif we could, would neither halt the killing nor reduce the brutality.\\n\\n>If 50% of ALL murders was done with axes, would you impose some regulations on them\\n>or just say that they are ment to be used at trees, and that the axe is not a problem,\\n>it\\'s the \\'axer\\' ??\\n>(An example, don\\'t flame me just because not exactly 50% are killed by guns...)\\n\\n\\n       In the U.S., approximately 60% of murders are commited with firearms.\\n(50% with handguns, 10% with non-handguns.)  The reason I say that guns, per \\nse, are not the problem, is that our non-gun rate exceeds most of Europe\\'s\\ncountries *entire* violent crime rate.  I don\\'t really think we\\'ve got\\nmore knives or fists.  \\n\\n       In any case, I think examples of gun control *applied* to the U.S.\\nhave been abkect failures, just like drug prohibition and other forms\\nof prohibition.  Until you deal with *why* people are doing what they\\nare doing, you won\\'t solve your problem.  And if the problem is \\nviolent crime, you shouldn\\'t concentrate on the tools instead.  The\\n*vast* majority of guns is never, ever misused.  (On the order of\\n99.5% over the entire lifetime of the gun).  This says to me that\\nyou can\\'t make the argument that the gun itself causes the misuse.\\n\\n>Think about the situation in Los Angeles where people are buying guns to protect\\n>themselves. Is this a good situation ?? \\n\\n       The situation is not \"good\" in that people fear for their lives.\\nBut recall the scenes of the store-owners during the last riots,\\nprotecting their shops with guns.  Would it have been better they,\\ntoo, lost their livelihoods?\\n\\n>Is it the rigth way to deal with the problem ??\\n\\n       The problem of poverty and rage in Los Angeles, no it isn\\'t.\\nHowever, if that problem becomes a violent action, then yes, it can\\nbe appropriate.  Whether or not some person has been hurt by their condition\\nwon\\'t make me less dead if they burn down my house with me in it.\\n\\n       You have to examine which problem you\\'re referring to.  If\\nyou\\'re discussing someone violently assaulting you, then it is\\na perfectly legitimate response to make them stop.  (Hopefully\\nsimply letting them know you\\'re prepared to shoot them would be enough,\\nas it was with the above-mentioned store-owners.)\\n\\n>If everybody buys guns to protect themselves from criminals (and their neighbor who have\\n>guns) what do you think will happen ?? (I mean if everybody had a gun in USA)\\n\\n       45% of Households have some form of firearm, usually a long gun.\\nThat accounts for a level of access for at least 100 million Americans.\\nFirearm ownership is most likely among educated, well-off whites, the\\ngroup *least* likely to be involved in violent crime.\\n\\n       You may take that for what it\\'s worth.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nDavid Veal Univ. of Tenn.

While the United States and 48 of the fifty states call their\\n   highest court \"Supreme Court,\" \"Supreme Judicial Court\" or \"Supreme\\n   Court of Appeals,\" Maryland and New York call theirs simply the\\n   \"Court of Appeals.\"  To make matters worse, New York also calls its\\n   _second-highest_ court the \"Supreme Court, Appellate Division\"...\\n\\nAtlantic Cement Co._, 26 N.Y.2d 219, 257 N.E.2d 870 (1970)):\\n\\nOscar H. Boomer, et al., owned land near the Atlantic Cement company\\'s\\nplant near Albany, N.Y.  (The fact pattern gives no information as to\\nwhich came first, the plaintiff\\'s acquisition of the land or he\\ndefendant\\'s start of production at their cement plant.)  In the course\\nof its regular operations, the cement plant did injury to the\\nplaintiffs\\' property via dirt, smoke and vibrations emanating from the\\nplant.  The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief -- that is, they asked\\nthe court to order Atlantic Cement to stop damaging their property.\\n\\n(Commentary: this seems entirely reasonable to me.  Boomer at al owned\\ntheir property and, presumably, a right to quiet enjoyment of it.\\nAtlantic Cement\\'s actions were depriving Boomer et al of that right.)\\n\\nInstead of granting the plaintiffs\\' request for an injunction, the court\\nordered them to accept the damage being done to their property, provided\\nthat Atlantic Cement paid them $185,000 in compensatory damages.  In\\nother words, the court granted Atlantic Cement Co., a private party, the\\npower and authority to _take_ the plaintiffs rights to quiet enjoyment\\nof their property by eminent domain.  A taking by eminent domain is\\nalways problematical even when it\\'s done by the state; allowing a\\nprivate firm to do it is, in my opinion, totally wrong.\\n\\n(Yes, I know, the _Boomer_ court didn\\'t call it eminent domain.  But if\\nit walks like eminent domain and swims like eminent domain and quacks\\nlike eminent domain...)\\n\\nLet me take issue with the way you\\'ve presented the case... you say that\\n\"What happened in _Boomer_ was that the judge didn\\'t allow the\\nplaintiffs to blackmail the cement plant by demanding a multi-million\\ndollar plant to be shut down over $185,000 in damages.\"  Blackmail?\\n\\n    (Pulls out Black\\'s Law Dictionary, Abridged 5th Edition....\\n    \"Blackmail: Unlawful demand of money or property under threat to\\n    do bodily harm, to injure property, to accuse of crime, or to expose\\n    disgraceful defects.  This crime is commonly included under\\n    extortion statutes.\")\\n\\nHow do you define as \"blackmail\" one party\\'s act of demanding the right\\nto set its own sale price for a unique piece of property which it owns\\nand which another party has expressed an interest in buying?  Or of\\ndemanding the right not to sell that property at any price?  As I see\\nit, Boomer et al, having found themselves in the fortunate position of\\nowning something which Atlantic Cement had to purchase if it wanted to\\nstay in business, had every right in the world to set whatever price\\nthey wanted.  There isn\\'t, or at least shouldn\\'t be, any law that says\\nthat you have to be a nice guy in your private business dealings.\\n\\nYou go on to say: \"The plant would never have been shut down -- the\\nplaintiff\\'s lawyers would have just negotiated a windfall settlement,\\nbecause the plaintiffs would prefer an amount greater than $185K to\\nhaving the plant shut down, while the plant would prefer any amount less\\nthan the value of the plant to have the plant continue in operation.\"\\n\\nIf so, so what?  Since when are the courts supposed to be in the\\nbusiness of preventing parties from reaping windfall settlements from\\nother parties when those settlements arise from wrongful acts by those\\nother parties?  If Atlantic Cement didn\\'t want to have to face a choice\\nbetween paying a windfall settlement or going out of business, well,\\nshouldn\\'t Atlantic Cement have thought of that before going _into_\\nbusiness?  (I note that as far as the facts show Boomer et al were _not_\\nthe parties responsible for bringing about this situation -- that was\\nAtlantic Cement\\'s own fault for choosing to build and operate the type\\nof plant they did where and when they did.)\\n\\nAnd then you say: \"Everyone\\'s property rights were protected; the\\nplaintiffs were made whole; unnecessary settlement costs were avoided.\"\\nAs above, I dispute your claim that the plaintiffs were \"made whole.\"\\nThey were, in fact, by court action deprived of their rights as owners\\nof property to choose to sell or not sell that property at a price\\nacceptable to them.  And for that deprivation they were _not_ made\\nwhole.  And again I ask: Since when are the courts supposed to be in the\\nbusiness of ensuring that \"unnecessary\" settlement costs are avoided?\\n(If so, I\\'ve been miseducated -- I always thought that the courts were\\nsupposed to be in the business of ensuring that justice is done.)\\n\\n> Is _Boomer_ really being taught as \"infamous?\"  That\\'s really sad if\\n> it is, because I fail to see how it\\'s less than completely sensible.\\n> You should read the law and economics stuff first-hand instead of\\n> filtered through teachers who clearly don\\'t like it, for whatever\\n> inexplicable reasons.\\n\\n(1) _Boomer_ is not being taught as \"infamous,\" at least not at my\\nschool.\\n\\n(Aside: Northeastern Law usually does a very good job of hiring for\\ntheir first-year, mandatory classes (such as Torts, where I first\\nencountered _Boomer_) instructors who, regardless of their personal\\nopinions, can and do teach the law neutrally.  When the students get\\ninto their second and third years, in which the students (a) can pick\\nand choose which courses to take (except for the mandatory Professional\\nResponsibility, of course) and (b) are presumed to be a bit more worldly\\nand self-confident, less likely to be consciously or sub-consciously\\nintimidated by Law School Professors and able to learn from openly\\nbiased instructors rather than be indoctrinated by them, the instructors\\ntend to be more open in expressing their own opinions.  This is\\nespecially true of part-time instructors who, in real life, are\\npracticing attorneys or sitting judges... this can be _very_\\neducational, sometimes far more so than being taught by a somewhat\\ncloistered scholar.  End of aside.)\\n\\nI called it infamous because that\\'s my opinion of it.  For the reasons\\nI\\'ve stated above, I believe it to be a triumph of something that I can\\nonly call \"economic correctness\" over justice.\\n\\n(2) It is \"completely sensible\" only if you believe that the alleged\\nright of the owners of Atlantic Cement to stay in business and avoid\\nlosing a lot of their own money due to their own wrongful act, and\\nthe alleged right of several hundred Atlantic Cement employees to\\nnot have their jobs disappear, should trump the rights of people who\\nown property which was damaged by Atlantic Cement\\'s wrongful acts.\\n(And if you believe that it is correct for the courts (or any other\\nbranch of government) to grant to private parties the right to take\\nother people\\'s property by eminent domain.)\\n\\n> You\\'d like Posner, Bill.  He\\'s a libertarian.\\n\\nReally?  I didn\\'t know that... what, if anything, has he had to say\\nabout cases like _Boomer_?\\n\\n> Of course, he has too much of a paper trail to ever be nominated by a\\n> president, Democrat (won\\'t like his antitrust stance) or Republican\\n> (won\\'t like his support of gay marriage), and if bright law students\\n> \"shiver\" at what they don\\'t understand, it\\'s easy to imagine how the\\n> press will play it up as baby-selling.  (I\\'ve seen Mike Godwin claim\\n> that Posner asserts that law and economics is applicable to everything\\n> and is the end-all and be-all, when Posner says precisely the\\n> opposite.)  So it goes.\\n\\nI\\'ve admitted that my understanding of the field generally referred to\\nas \"law and economics\" is weak.  If it advocates the use of economical\\nanalysis as one of many \"tie-breaker\" factors which courts may use to\\nhelp them reach decisions in cases in which the dispute, as measured by\\nthe scale of \"justice\", is evenly balanced, fine.  But as illustrated by\\n_Boomer_, it is _not_ fine when the courts start viewing the economics\\nof a case as being more important than the justice of a case.\\n\\n-- William December Starr <wdstarr@athena.mit.edu>\\n\\n',\n",

And if you do see a biblical\\nbasis for same-sex marriages, how willing would gay Christians be to\\n\"save themselves\" for such a marriage and to never have sexual\\nintercourse with anyone outside of that marriage relationship?  Please\\nnote that I am not trying to imply that gay Christians would not be\\nwilling to be so monogamous, I am genuinely interested in hearing\\nopinions on the subject.

Clarke\\n\\nKrieger Publishing Company\\nMelbourne, Florida, USA\\nOrig. Ed. 1993\\nPre-publication $84.50\\nISBN 0-89464-039-9\\n\\n\\nThis text is a history of the spaceship as both a cultural and a\\ntechnological phenomenon.  The idea of a vehicle for traversing the\\nspace betwen worlds did not spring full-blown into existence in the\\ntlatter half of theis century.  The need preceded the ability ot make\\nsuch a device by several hundred years.  As soon as it was realized\\nthat there were other worlds than this one, human beings wanted to\\nreach them.   \\n\\nTracing the history of the many imaginative, and often prescient,\\nattempts to solve this problem also reflects the history of\\ntechnology, science, astronomy, and engineering.  Once space travel\\nbecame feasible, there were many more spacecraft concepts developed\\nthan ever got off the drawing board-- or off the ground, for that\\nmatter.  These also are described in theis book, for the same reason\\nas the pre-space-age and pre-flight ideas are:  they are all accurate\\nreflections of their particular era's dreams, abilities, and\\nknowledge.  Virtually every spaceship concept invented since 1500, as\\nwell as selected events important in developing the idea of\\nextraterrestrial travel, is listed chronologically.  The chronological\\nentries allow comparisons between actual astronautical events and\\nspeculative ventures.  They also allow comparisons between\\nsimultaneous events taking place in different countries.  They reveal\\nconnections, influences, and evolutions hitherto unsuspected.  Every\\nentry is accompanied by at least one illustration.  Nearly every\\nspacecraft concept is illustrated with a schematic drawing.  This\\nallows accurate comparisons to be made between designss, to visualize\\ndifferences, similarities, and influences.\\n\\nThis text will be of interest to students of astronautical history,\\nand also to model builders who would be interested in the schematic\\ndiagrams.   Science fiction fans as well as aviation history buffs and\\nhistorians of science will also find this book to be fascinating.  The\\nunique collection of illustrations makes it a visually attractive and\\nvery interesting history of the spaceship.\\n\\nSPECIAL FEATURES\\n\\nIncludes scale drawings of several hundred spacecraft, both real and\\nfictional\\n\\nContains scores of illustrations: artwork, drawings, and photos\\ncontemporary with the subject.

Fante} \\\\endauthor\\n\\\\date {April 20, 1993} \\\\enddate\\n\\\\endtopmatter\\n\\nIn a letter to the FBI, David Koresh said: ``Do you want me to\\npull back the heavens and show you my anger?! ... fear me.''  The 51 day\\nstandoff between federal agents and the Branch Davidians ended on April 19\\nin what appeared to be a mass suicide by fire.  Now that the multi-million\\ndollar standoff is over, a few things remain: cleaning up the mess, and\\nassigning blame.\\n\\n\\\\\\n\\nFrom the onset of the April 19 tear gas attacks by federal agents, President\\nClinton already started passing the buck by saying ``Talk to the attorney\\ngeneral or the FBI... I knew it was going to be done, but the decision was\\n{\\\\it entirely theirs}.  {\\\\it They} made the tactical decision.'' Enter\\nAttorney General Janet Reno.  After most of the Branch Davidians died,\\nReno said she took ``full responsibility'' for the decision.  ``I approved\\nthe plan'' she said adding that she ``did not advise him [Clinton] as to the\\ndetails.''  In fact, she told Clinton that it was ``the best way to go.''\\nAs the fire was roaring through the Branch Davidian's compound Clinton said\\nthat he was ``deeply sadened by the loss of life'' and in the same breath that\\n``the law enforcement agencies involved in the Waco siege recommended the\\ncourse of action pursued today.''  Later he went on to say ``I stand by that\\n[Reno's] decision.''\\n\\n\\\\\\n\\nHow did this all begin?  At 0930 on February 28 agents of the Bureau of\\nAlcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) launched a full-scale, high-profile\\nassault on the Branch Davidian's compound.  This raid was much\\nmore than an assault on a group suspected of possessing illegal weapons.  The\\nassault was a planned media circus used as a propaganda device of the BATF\\nto show their might and just purpose.\\n\\n\\\\\\n\\nAt the onset of the ``no-knock'' raid, gaggles of heavily armed BATF agents\\nmade their way inside the compound without identifying themselves or state\\nthat they had a warrant until long after the shooting began.\\nSilently, the agents made their way to the compound's buildings and started\\ntheir ``search'' by charging at the buildings and throwing concussion grenades\\nand ordering the cult members to come out of the buildings.\\n\\n\\\\\\n\\nIf unknown persons dressed in black ninja costumes and combat fatigues\\nwere to attack you, throwing grenades and brandishing firearms, would you not\\nassume that these people are criminals and attempt to defend yourself?  The\\ntactics employed by the BATF provoked the battle.\\n\\n\\\\\\n\\nThe initial assualt by the BATF was not successful.  Unfortunately, lives\\nwere lost on both sides.  But, had the assault been a success, the liberal\\nmedia would have praised the BATF by showing the footage of BATF agents\\ncarting away a bunch of gun-wielding religious nuts.  Of course, any\\nviolation of the cult's rights would have been overlooked and the media\\nwould proclaim America's fortune in having super-cop organizations like the\\nBATF that can systematically ``take out'' terroristic groups such as the\\nBranch Davidians.\\n\\n\\\\\\n\\nAs far as I can see, the BATF and the FBI dropped the ball - just like\\nPhiladelphia did in the 1985 MOVE crisis which left 11 dead, 250 homeless,\\nand a city block razed.\\nIt appears that the BATF has adopted the shoot-first tactic of no-knock\\nraids to execute search warrants.  Don't let the BATF convince you that\\nthe no-knock raid was justified.  No-knock assaults make sense when looking\\nfor, say, drugs that can easily be hidden or disposed of in a few seconds.\\nThe BATF was looking for illegal weapons, not drugs that could be hidden or\\nflushed down the toilet in a matter of a few seconds.  What ever happened to\\n``This is the police!  You are surrounded...''?  {\\\\it This policy of no-knock\\nraids, by federal and local agencies, should be restricted}.  Further, the use\\nof military firepower against presumed innocent citizens is a very scary idea,\\nand is why the Davidians were justified in using lethal force to ensure that\\ntheir fourth ammendment rights [``the right of the people to be secure in\\ntheir persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches\\nand seizures''] are not denied.\\n\\n\\\\\\n\\n\\\\\\n\\n\\\\\\n\\n\\\\noindent Matthew L.

There is no question here of the\\nsimplistic idea of karma as a machine that is the sole determiner\\nof one\\'s destiny.  Even the eastern traditions, or many of them,\\ndo not say that, as one knowledgeable poster pointed out.\\n\\nAnd if in fact that Paul did not know about or believe in reincarnation\\ndoes not say anything one way or another about it.  Even John the Baptist,\\nwho Jesus says emphatically is Elijah (Matt 11:14), does not appear to \\nhave been aware of it, at least at the point at which he was asked. But \\nit is interesting that his threefold denial -- to the question whether \\nhe is the Christ, the Prophet (i.e. Isaiah), or Elijah, is emphatic in \\nthe first case and very weak in the third.\\n\\nI would like to add once again that, while it is important to discuss the\\ndifferent passages that may point directly to the teaching of repeated\\nearth lives, one way or another, what I really see as important in our\\ntime is that the subject be revisited in terms of the larger view of\\nChristianity and Christian doctrine.  For the most part, those who do\\naccept it either reject the central ideas of Christianity or, if they\\nare Christians, hold their conviction as a kind of separate treasure.\\nI believe that Christianity has important new understanding to bring\\nto bear on it, and vice versa, much that is central to Christianity\\ntakes on entirely new dimensions of meaning in light of repeated earth\\nlives.

Not that I hold him as an\\nauthority, but the whole picture of Christianity becomes clearer in light\\nof these ideas.  Steiner indicated that the old consciousness of reincar-\\nnation necessarily had to fade away that it could be renewed in later\\ntimes, after a time of development of the Christ idea through the first\\ntwo millenia after Christ\\'s deed on Golgotha.  In our own time, it becomes \\nimportant that, having received the basic gospel of salvation, our \\nunderstanding of life and of the human being can now grow to embrace the \\nsignificance of this idea.  For the discussions in this newsgroup, I \\nhave tried to focus on that which can be related as directly as possible \\nto scripture and to fundamental Christian teaching and tradition.\\n\\nGerry Palo (73237.2006@compuserve.com)\\n',\n",

And, it is unclear whether the \\'040 processor on the non-FPU system\\n>(a 68LC040) can be replaced with a 68RC040 supplied by another vendor.\\n\\n    This is not unclear at all.

This\\ndoesn\\'t mean that environmentalism is wrong, any more than supporting peace in\\nthe Middle East is wrong because Jews and Muslims also work for it.\\n\\n  Nonetheless, paganism is certainly on the rise, and we as Christians should\\naddress this and look at what draws people from paganism to Christianity.  Like\\nit or not, pagan religions are addressing needs that Christianity should be,\\nand isn\\'t.  \\n  I believe that paganism has hit upon some major truths that Christianity has\\nforgotten.  This doesn\\'t mean that paganism is right, but it does mean that we\\nhave something to learn from the pagan movement.\\n  First, paganism respects the feminine.  Christianity has a long history of\\noppressing women, and many (if not most) male Christians are still unable to\\nlive in a non-sexist manner.  The idea that God is sexless, or that Christ \\ncould have been a women and still accomplished his mission, is met with a great\\ndeal of resistance.  This insistance on a male-dominated theology (and the \\nmale-dominated society that goes with it) drives away many young women who have\\nhad to put up with sexist attitudes in their churches.\\n  Second, paganism respects the physical world.  This is an idea with great\\nramifications.  One of these is environmentalism--respect for our surroundings\\nand our world.  Another is integration of sexuality.  Christianity has a long\\ntradition of calling ALL sexual feeelings sinful and urging people to suppress\\nand deny their sexuality.  This is too much--sex is clearly a part of human\\nexperience and attempting to remove it is simply not a feasible option.  \\nChristianity has only begun to develop a workable sexual ethic, and paganism\\nis an attractive option.\\n  I\\'m not advocating that Christian doctrines (no sex before marriage, etc.)\\nshould be changed--just that Christians work toward a more moderate ethic of\\nsexuality.  Denial of sexuality places as much emphasis on sex as unmoderated\\nsexuality, and neither one does much to bring us closer to God.\\n\\nAlan Terlep\\t\\t\\t\\t    \"Incestuous vituperousness\"\\nOakland University, Rochester, MI\\t\\t\\t\\natterlep@vela.acs.oakland.edu\\t\\t\\t\\t   --Melissa Eggertsen\\nRushing in where angels fear to tread.\\t\\t\\n',\n",

Since this aunt and uncle have 5 kids I felt they would be more\\nrelevant than I, who have none (yet).\\n\\n>1.  Ages & sexes of children\\n     13-year-old (13YO) twins, 10YO boy, 6.5YO boy, 2YO girl\\n\\n>2.  Do you spank your kids?\\n     I don\\'t call it spanking, but they do, so yes, very rarely.\\n\\n>3.  If so how often?\\n     I don\\'t call it spanking because it\\'s more of a reaction to something\\nvery dangerous, such as trying to stick their finger in a fan or running\\ninto the road.  Maybe 3-4 times for each except for the 2YO girl, who has\\nnot been spanked yet.\\n     They call it that because it *does* hurt their feelings, and of course\\nI give all the hugs and stuff to ensure they know they\\'re still loved.\\n\\n>4.  Do you use an implement to spank with?\\n     No, that would be too painful.  If it\\'s too traumatic they never recall\\nwhy they were punished.  Besides, it must be immediate, and taking the time\\nto go get a toolmeans you\\'re not doing it right away, and that lessens the\\nimpact.  It\\'s very emotional for a child as it is - which is evidenced by the\\nfact that a little slap on the rear - which hurts for perhaps 5 seconds -\\nis called a spanking.\\n>\\n>5. If you do not spank, what method of discipline do you use?\\n     Lots of logical consequences - for instance, when 4YO Matthew dared\\na good friend to jump out of his treehouse or he would push him out, I made\\nsure they didn\\'t play together for 5 days so he\\'d know that would make him\\nlose friends very quickly.  He\\'s never done anything like that since.\\n     We also use time-out in their rooms - I use a timer so they don\\'t keep\\narguing with me over leaving, since it\\'s hard to argue with a macine.\\nI will go to the closed door and tell them timeout won\\'t be over until they\\ncalm down if they\\'re too tantrumy.  I use the top of the stairs when they\\'re\\nreally young.\\n\\n>6.  Your age?\\n     40\\n\\n>7.  Your location\\n     Bath, Ohio.  It\\'s right outside of Akron, in the northeast part of Ohio.\\n\\n>8.  While under the age of 16 did you ever commit a criminal\\n>offence?\\n     No, and none of my kids would dream of it.  I hope you can use this to\\nteach all parents that physical punishment isn\\'t always required - parents use\\nthat as an excuse to hit too hard.\\n\\n>9.  How ere you disciplined as a kid\\n     Lots of timeouts, same as I use.  Our family and my husband\\'s have never\\nused spankings.  In fact, my grandmother in law was one of 11 kids, and they\\nwere almost never spanked.  This was around the turn of the century.  And,\\nnone of us has ever been afoul of the law - man-made or God\\'s law.\\n     Jesus says, referring to a small child whom he is holding, that \"what\\nye do to the least of these, ye do also to me.\"  The Bible also says in all\\nthings to be kind, and merciful, and especially loving. (Colossians 3:12-15.)\\nThere is no room for selfish anger, which I\\'ll admit I\\'ve been tempted with\\nat times.  When I\\'ve felt like spanking hard in anger, maybe the kid deserved\\na little slap on the rear, but what I would have given would have been the\\ndevil\\'s work.  I could feel the temptation, and just angrily ordered the kid\\nto his/her room and went to my room myself.  After praying and asking God\\'s\\nforgiveness, I was much calmer, and did not feel like spanking, but felt that\\nwhat I had done was enough punishment.\\n-- \\nDoug Fowler: dxf12@po.CWRU.edu  : Me, age 4 & now: \"Mommys and Daddys & other\\n    Ever wonder if, after Casey : relatives have to give lots of hugs & love\\nmissed the 3rd strike in the poem: & support, \\'cause Heaven is just a great\\nhe ran to first and made it?     : big hug that lasts forever and ever!!!\"\\n',\n",

Some of what I \\nwould complain about is rooted in aesthetics.  Many readers may \\nnever have known a time where the heavens were pristine - sacred - \\nunsullied by the actions of humans.  The space between the stars \\nas profoundly black as an abyss can be.  With full horizons and \\na pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time \\n- none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man. \\nAny lights were supplied solely by nature; uncorruptable by men.  \\nWhole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there \\nand becoming immortal as the stars, whether by apotheosis or a belief \\nin an afterlife.  \\n\\nThe Space Age changed all that.  The effect of the first Sputniks \\nand Echo, etc. on this view could only happen once.  To see a light \\ncrossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people \\nis still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating \\nthe scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or \\nthousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe.  \\nBut there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky. \\n\\nYes, I know aircraft are almost always in sight.  I have to live \\nin a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport \\ncurrently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly.  The \\nimpact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists \\nthat has not been shaped, sculpted, modified, trashed or whipped \\ninto shape by the hands of man.  In some places the only life \\nforms larger than bacteria are humans, cockroaches, and squirrels \\n(or rats).  I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains \\none weekend, \"getting away from it all\" (paved roads, indoor plumbing, \\nmalls, ...) and it felt good for a while - then I quickly noticed \\nthe hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles - 60-80 \\nmiles to the east.  (Their \\'security light\\' didn\\'t help matters \\nmuch either.)  But I\\'ve heard the artic wilderness gets lots of \\nhigh air traffic.  So I know the skies are rarely perfect. \\n\\nBut there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn\\'t \\nfouled in some way.  (I mean they\\'ve been TRYING this forever - \\nlike, concerning Tesla\\'s idea to banish night, - wow!)  I don\\'t watch \\ncommercial television, but I can imagine just how disgusting beer, \\ntruck, or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high.  \\nIf ya\\' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven), at \\nleast consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last\\nbeautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life.  \\n\\nTo be open about this though, I have here my listing of the passage \\nof HST in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight Friday at \\n8:25 p.m. EDT it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the \\nlocal meridian from Baltimore vicinity.  I\\'ll be trying to see it \\nif I can - it _is_ my mealticket after all.  So I suppose I could \\nbe called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky \\nwhile complaining about billboards proposed by others.

Ideally, these questions could be\\nasked at any investigation into the BATF\\'s and FBI\\'s participation\\nat the WACO fiasco in hopes of being resolved and, hopefully, wake\\nup the local news media that they are not getting the entire truth\\nfrom the BATF and FBI.  My list is up to 13 that are really nagging \\nat my gut.  The list will probably grow. \\n\\n1.   What were the contents of the original warrant, now sealed, that\\n     the BATF obtained?\\n\\n2.   It is reasonable to believe that illegal firearms and/or ammunition\\n     could not be flushed down the toilet.  Therefore, a \"no-knock\"\\n     raid could be ruled out.  Prior to the initial assault on the \\n     complex, did a single BATF agent and accompanying witness (without \\n     a contingent of assault and news media personnel) attempt to knock \\n     on the door of the Branch Davidian\\'s complex and serve the warrant \\n     in a manner prescribed by law?\\n\\n3.   On the day of the initial assault on the complex, BATF agents\\n     were aware that several small children were inside the buildings.\\n     In the ensueing gun battle, BATF agents fired into a building\\n     known to contain children, killing at least one two-year old child.\\n     Knowing children were present, why didn\\'t the BATF have an\\n     alternate plan and immediately retreat from the area close to\\n     the complex and implement the alternate plan rather than opening\\n     fire and jeopardizing the lives of the children in the building? \\n\\n4.   The FBI spokesman states that paper evidence indicates that\\n     David Koresh and members of the Branch Davidians possessed over\\n     $200,000 in firearms and ammunition.  Did David Koresh and the\\n     members of the Branch Davidians have a valid Federal Firearms\\n     License, were they actively participating in the legal business\\n     of selling/buying firearms and ammunition, and were any of the\\n     weapons they had illegally possessed?  Does this paper evidence\\n     consist only of weapons purchased or does it include legally\\n     dispossessed weapons.\\n\\n5.   After the original assault on the compound tragically failed,\\n     a BATF spokeswoman stated \"We were outgunned!\".  Yet, TV newscasts\\n     of video tape filmed at the time of the incident show BATF agents\\n     armed with MP-5 and AR-15/M16 rifles.  Although unclear on the\\n     video tape because of obstruction from full view by agent\\'s\\n     bodies, they also may have had AK-47 and SKS rifles.  What type(s)\\n     of firearms did the BATF agents have immediate access to at the \\n     scene of the original assault on the complex?\\n\\n6.   Since there is no evidence to confirm anyone was inside the\\n     complex involuntarily, why did the FBI treat it as a \"hostage\"\\n     situation? \\n\\n7.   Along the same lines, why did the FBI use \"psychological warfare\"\\n     techniques, including sensory overload, sleep deprivation, and\\n     other disruptive techniques that would test the sanity of any \\n     normal person rather than using techniques aimed at placing the \\n     complex occupants into a calmer frame of mind?\\n\\n8.   Reports indicate several of the children inside the complex\\n     were accompanied by their mothers.  Since it is reasonable\\n     to expect these mothers would have their children taken away\\n     from them if they came out, why did the FBI expect the mothers\\n     to just walk out and surrender themselves to the authorities?\\n\\n9.   Agents at the scene claim to have seen members of the Branch\\n     Davidians setting fire to the complex.  Branch Davidian members\\n     who survived the inferno claim the fire was started when an \\n     armored vehicle punched through the wall and knocked over a \\n     lantern which was setting on a table.  Video tape of the incident \\n     does show an armored vehicle punching a hole in the wall and the \\n     fire erupted almost immediately from the same general location.  \\n     Was the source of the fire the same room where the armored vehicle \\n     penetrated?\\n\\n10.  FBI spokesmen are voicing the opinion that the David Koresh and\\n     the members of the Branch Davidians committed mass suicide.  Yet,\\n     bodies are being discovered throughout the house and other areas\\n     within the building complex.  This seems to be counter to any\\n     known mass suicides through history.  What evidence does the FBI\\n     have that a mass suicide pact existed?\\n\\n11.  FBI Director Sessions stated that the massive fireball shown on\\n     the video tape was caused by the Branch Davidian\\'s ammunition\\n     and/or powder cache exploding.  Yet, the fireball seems to be\\n     more characteristic of the type created when compressed gas\\n     or other highly volatile fuel source explodes.  Was any evidence \\n     found which would indicate the Branch Davidians had an ammunition \\n     and/or powder cache which exploded to create this fireball?  If so,\\n     and if David Koresh and members of the Branch Davidians were \\n     engaged in the legal business of selling/buying firearms, was the\\n     amount determined to be excessively greater than one would expect\\n     for someone engaged in such a legal business?\\n\\n12.  It is rumored that one FBI agent was extremely upset about critical\\n     news media coverage and intentionally used an armored vehicle to\\n     crush a reporter\\'s car which had been left at the compound.  Is \\n     there any factual basis to this rumor and, if so, what charges will \\n     be brought against the FBI agent who performed the act?\\n\\n13.  FBI Director Sessions states that, during the final assault on the\\n     complex, \"over 80 shots were fired at the vehicles.\"  On the video\\n     tape of the incident, you can hear the drone of the armored vehicles\\n     engines.  Yet, there is no sound of the sharp reports that one\\n     would expect to hear if shots were fired.  Also, there are no \\n     indications of smoke and/or muzzle flashes appearing from the windows,\\n     buildings or other structures in the video.  Surely, these should be \\n     evident if the Branch Davidians had fired on the armored vehicles.  \\n     Finally, the video tape does not show any indication of paint splatter, \\n     sparks or other characteristic spray of material which should be \\n     apparent if the Branch Davidians had fired upon the vehicles.  Do \\n     any of the armored vehicles which were brought in to pump tear gas \\n     into the compound show evidence of fresh damage due to being hit by \\n     shots from high-power rifles?\\n\\n14.  CS gas is considered to be a chemical warfare agent.  The United\\n     States has signed international treaties which prevent the use\\n     of CS gas in warfare.  If the United States could not morally use\\n     CS gas against Saddam Hussein and his troops, why is it morally\\n     acceptable to use the same agent against citizens of our own land?\\n\\n15.  On April 21, FBI spokesmen state that at least 3 bodies discovered\\n     in the complex had bullet wounds to the head indicating they had\\n     been murdered or had committed suicide.  On April 22, the county\\n     coroner claims he knows nothing about any bodies found with bullet\\n     wounds to the head.  Were any of the victims bodies found within\\n     the burned out complex have bullet wounds to the head?\\n-- \\n**************************************************************\\n* Ron Phillips               crphilli@hound.dazixca.ingr.com *\\n* Senior Customer Engineer                                   *\\n* Intergraph Electronics                                     *\\n* 381 East Evelyn Avenue               VOICE: (415) 691-6473 *\\n* Mountain View, CA 94041              FAX:   (415) 691-0350 *\\n**************************************************************\\n',\n",

The Viking was a trick little unit made way back when\\n(forties? fifties?) when Spag was trying to make a go of it in racing.\\nThe first iteration (the Springer) was a boxer twin, very similar to Max\\nFriz\\'s famous design, but with an overhead \"point cam\" (see below for\\nmore on the valvetrain). The problem was that the thing had no ground\\nclearance whatsoever. The solution was to curve the cylinder bores, so\\nthat the ground clearance was substantially increased:\\n\\n\\n      ==@==   <-Springer motor (front)\\n                 Viking motor (front) ->   \\\\=@=/\\n\\nThis is roughly the idea, except that the bores were gradually curved\\naround a radius, as the pistons were loath to make a sharp-angled turn\\nin the middle of their stroke. The engine also had curved connecting\\nrods to accomodate the stroke.\\n\\nThe engine stuck out so far because of its revolutionary (and still\\nunique) overhead cam system. Through the use of clever valve timing and\\nand extrordinarily trick valve linkage, only a single cam lobe was\\nrequired to drive both overhead valves.\\n\\nJust as revolutionary was the hydraulic valve actuation, which used a\\npressurized stream of oil to power the \"waterwheel\" which kept the lobe\\nspinning over. One side effect that required some rather brutal\\nengineering fixes was that until the engine\\'s oil pressure came up to\\nnormal, the engine\\'s valve timing would be more or less random,\\nresulting in some impressive start-up valve damage. The solution was a\\nlittle hand crank that pressurized the cases before you started the\\nbeast, remarkably similar to the system used in new Porsches to\\npressurize the oil system before the car is started (the cage, however,\\nuses an electric oil pump. Wimps).\\n\\nDespite this fix, the engine had a nasty propensity for explosively\\nfiring its valves into the pistons when a cylinder would temporarily\\nlose a bit of oil pressure in a corner. The solution was to run even\\nhigher oil pressures and change the gaskets and seals regularly. This\\nwas feasible because it was a racing engine.\\n\\nWith just a single overhead lobe, and no pushrod/shaft/chain towers\\nbecause of the hydraulic system, the head of the engine came to an\\nalmost perfect point:\\n\\n                    /\\\\\\n                   /()\\\\   <-lobe\\n                  / XX \\\\  <-complex linkage (not shown due to\\n valvestems ->   / \\\\  / \\\\    complexity)\\n                |  |   | |\\n                |  |===| |\\n                    =0=  <---piston\\n                     |\\n                             Note that the tip was not truly vertical\\n                             (it was at about a 70 degree angle to the\\n                             ground, and this drawing doesn\\'t show the\\n                             curvature because there was none in the\\n                             head itself.

Your HD stopped boot probably because your HD controller can't handle the faster BUS speed.  I have a 486-33DX, I set my bus divider to CLK/2.5, that is close to 13MHz.

The question is,\\nis one of the effect dominant, and which one is it? The idea would be to\\ndesign an experiment which would seaprate the two characteristics, and\\nsee which effect produces a similar result to the one with which those of\\nus who have bikes are familiar.\\n\\nLet\\'s look at the one that, so far, has sparked no controversy on its\\nown, gyroscopic precession. To examine this alone, we would have to\\nget rid of the contact patch effect, by not allowing the contact patches\\nto transmit any force. The wheels and steering mechanism would have to\\nremain, and be attached to a vehicle with about the same weight as a bike,\\nthrough suspension (so that the wheels transmit forces to the bike the\\nsame way) similar to a bikes. An experiment would be to ride a bike along \\na dry road to get moving and to get the wheels spinning, then change \\nsurfaces to something that won\\'t transmit forces through the contact \\npatches, and try a steering manoeuvre to see if the bike leans. It \\nprobably would, since some of us know how easy it is to fall down on ice, \\nbut we wouldn\\'t get a good idea of how well or what it feels like \\nbecause, without the contact patches, we can\\'t turn.  Maybe there\\'s a \\nbetter way. Besides, even ice doesn\\'t get rid of the contact patch\\nforces altogether, so we\\'d have to find a really frictionless surface.\\nYou\\'d have to try it again with the wheels locked to really know if it\\nwas the rotation that did it.\\n\\nLooking at the contact-patch effect only, however, is fairly simple.\\nNow we have to find a vehicle that gets the about the same magnitude and\\ndirection of cantact patch forces as a motorcycle, and transmits them\\nabout the same way to the vehicle, but without rotating wheels.\\nHow it gets the contact patch forces is irrelevant, we\\'re just looking\\nfor something that has contact patches that can go straight and not\\nsideways, and skis or skates would do fine. I don\\'t know of any snow-ski\\nor skate bikes, but up here we have the Suzuki Wetbike that is arranged\\nlike a motorcycle but has fat water skis where there should be wheels.\\nI think the propellor is in front of the rear ski, or something like\\nthat, but we could try it at a coast to get rid of most of its effect.\\nNow I admit that this is second hand info (although I\\'d love to try\\none of these), but the review in the local cycle rag and a guy in\\na bike shop that sells them both say that this machine handles very\\nmuch like a motorcycle, in that you countersteer it to turn.\\nSo we have contact patches that transmit similar forces to a bike\\'s,\\na similar suspension arrangement, and no gyroscopes, but we do have\\ncountersteering.\\n\\nConclusion: you don\\'t need gyroscopes to countersteer vehicles that have\\nmotorcycle-like contact patch arrangements. We still don\\'t know what\\nreal effect the gyroscopes have when they\\'re there, but from my observations\\nof how handlebar angle, force, etc. relate to steering in general, I\\'m \\nwilling to bet that they\\'re not the dominant factor in countersteering. \\n\\nIf you don\\'t like this conclusion, then don\\'t accept it, but my motorcycle\\'s\\nbehaviour is consistent with it.

The thrust of the passage\\nin its context is to liken the one time incarnation and \\nsacrifice of Christ for all mankind to the individual \\nexperience of the human being after death.  The \"once\" \\nis repeated and emphasized, and it highlights the singularity \\nof Christ\\'s deed.  One thing for certain it does is to \\nrefute the claims of some that Christ incarnates more than \\nonce.  But the comparison to the human experience - die \\nonce, then judgement (note: not \"the judgement\", but just \\n\"judgement\".  The word for judgement is \"krisis\".\\n\\nHebrews 9:27 is the one passage most often quoted in defense\\nof the doctrine that the Bible denies reincarnation.  At this\\npoint, I would just emphasize again that the  passages \\nthat (arguably) speak against it are few, and that invariably\\nthey are talking about something eles, and the apparent denial\\nof reincarnation is either inferred, or, as in the case of\\nHebrews, taken literally and deposited into an implied context,\\nnamely a doctrine of the destiny of the human being after\\ndeath.\\n\\nWhat should be considered seriously is that the Bible is essentially\\nsilent about the fate of the individual human being between death\\nand the Last Day.  If you take the few passages that could possibly\\nbe interpreted to mean a single earth life, they are arguable.  And\\nthere are other passages that point, arguably, in the other direc-\\ntion. such as Matthew 11:14 and John 9:2.\\n\\nWe can continue to debate the individual scraps of scripture that\\nmight have a bearinig on this, and indeed we should discuss them.\\nBut what I wanted to introduce into the discussion was an approach\\nto the idea of repeated earth lives that, unlike Hindu, Buddhist\\nand \"new age\" teachings, takes full cognizance of the divinity, singular\\nincarnation, death, burial, resurrection, and second coming of Christ\\nas the savior of mankind; the accountability of each individual for\\nhis deeds and the reality of the Fall and of sin and its consequences;\\nthe redemption of man from sin through Christ; the resurrection of\\nthe body, and the Last Judgement.\\n\\nTaken in this larger sense, many serious questions take on an entirely\\ndifferent perspective.  E.g. the destiny of those who died in their\\nsins before Christ came. the relationship of faith and grace to \\nworks, the meaning of \"deathbed conversion\", the meaning of the\\nsacraments, and many other things.  Not that I propose to answer all\\nthose questions by a simple doctrine of convenience, but only that\\nthe discussion takes on a different dimension, and in my opinion\\none that is truly worthy of both man, the earth, and their Creator and \\nRedeemer. There are many deep questions that continue to be deep, such \\nas the meaning of the second death, and how the whole of Christian\\ndoctrine would apply to this larger perspective of human existence.\\n\\nThere are those who deeply believe that the things of which the Bible \\ndoes not speak are not things we should be concerned with.  But Christ\\nalso indicated that there were other things that we would come to know\\nin the future, including things that his disciples (and therefore others) \\ncould not bear yet.  This idea that the human capacity for growth in\\nknowledge, not only of the individual in one lifetime, but of the whole\\nof humanity, also takes on great meaning when we realize that our growth\\nin the spirit is a long term process.  The Bible was not meant to codify\\nall spiritual knowledge in one place forever, but to proclaim the gospel\\nof the incarnation and redeeming deed of Christ - taking the gospel in the\\ngreater context, from Genesis to Revelation.  Now, salvation (healing) becomes, \\nnot the end of man\\'s sojourn but its beginning.  And the Last Judgement and\\nthe New Heaven and Earth that follow it become its fulfullment.\\n\\nGerry Palo (73237.2006@compuserve.com)\\n',\n",

The old CMOS\\n\\tfamily, still viable because of *very* wide range of devices, low\\n\\tpower consumption, and wide range of supply voltages.  Not fast.\\n\\tVery forgiving and easy to work with (beware static electricity,\\n\\tbut that comment applies to many other modern logic families too).\\n\\tThere are neat devices in this family that exist in no other.

Possibly a good choice for\\n\\tgeneral-purpose logic, assuming availability and affordability.\\n\\tCMOS logic levels, *not* TTL ones.  Beware very limited range of\\n\\tsupply voltages compared to older CMOS, also major rise of power\\n\\tconsumption at faster speeds.\\n\\n74HCT\\t74HC with TTL logic levels.

The low end of ECL.  Various sources\\n\\tclaim that it is *easier* to work with than super-fast TTL for\\n\\tserious high-speed work.

Harder to handle than 10K, and\\n\\tinconvenient packages.  Much more useful datasheets, however.\\n\\nAs for compatibility between families:  the 74 families (except 74C and\\n74HC) are all more or less logic-level compatible, but how many 74X devices\\nyou can drive from one 74Y output varies enormously with X and Y.  You just\\nhave to read the specs and do the arithmetic.  74C and 74HC are compatible\\nwith the others with a bit of hassle.  4000 compatibility can be a bit of\\nhassle or a lot of hassle depending on what supply voltage 4000 is using.\\n10K or 100K to anything else is considerable hassle.\\n\\nMe?

And in the NHL,\\nthere exist these things called \"ties\".  A tie occurs when a game ends\\nwith the score for each team equal.  Each team gets one point for a tie. \\nThere also exits these things called \"wins\".  A win is when one team has a\\nhigher score than the opponent.

So, let\\'s say that a team has a record of 38 wins, 36 losses, and 10\\nties.  Another team has a record of 40 wins, 38 losses and 6 ties.  The\\nfirst team has (38*2)+10 = 86 points.  The second team has (40*2)+6 = 86\\npoints.  WOW!  They *both* have the same number of points, but the number\\nof wins is different!  How did they do that??!?!?!?!  That\\'s amazing.

Many classifiers achieve very\\nhigh F-scores, but their results would not generalize to other documents that\\naren\\'t from this window of time.\\n\\nFor example, let\\'s look at the results of a multinomial Naive Bayes classifier,\\nwhich is fast to train and achieves a decent F-score::\\n\\n  >>> from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB\\n  >>> from sklearn import metrics\\n  >>> newsgroups_test = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'test\\',\\n  ...                                      categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> clf = MultinomialNB(alpha=.01)\\n  >>> clf.fit(vectors, newsgroups_train.target)\\n  MultinomialNB(alpha=0.01, class_prior=None, fit_prior=True)\\n\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(newsgroups_test.target, pred, average=\\'macro\\')\\n  0.88213...\\n\\n(The example :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_text_plot_document_classification_20newsgroups.py` shuffles\\nthe training and test data, instead of segmenting by time, and in that case\\nmultinomial Naive Bayes gets a much higher F-score of 0.88. Are you suspicious\\nyet of what\\'s going on inside this classifier?)\\n\\nLet\\'s take a look at what the most informative features are:\\n\\n  >>> import numpy as np\\n  >>> def show_top10(classifier, vectorizer, categories):\\n  ...     feature_names = vectorizer.get_feature_names_out()\\n  ...     for i, category in enumerate(categories):\\n  ...         top10 = np.argsort(classifier.coef_[i])[-10:]\\n  ...         print(\"%s: %s\" % (category, \" \".join(feature_names[top10])))\\n  ...\\n  >>> show_top10(clf, vectorizer, newsgroups_train.target_names)\\n  alt.atheism: edu it and in you that is of to the\\n  comp.graphics: edu in graphics it is for and of to the\\n  sci.space: edu it that is in and space to of the\\n  talk.religion.misc: not it you in is that and to of the\\n\\n\\nYou can now see many things that these features have overfit to:\\n\\n- Almost every group is distinguished by whether headers such as\\n  ``NNTP-Posting-Host:`` and ``Distribution:`` appear more or less often.\\n- Another significant feature involves whether the sender is affiliated with\\n  a university, as indicated either by their headers or their signature.\\n- The word \"article\" is a significant feature, based on how often people quote\\n  previous posts like this: \"In article [article ID], [name] <[e-mail address]>\\n  wrote:\"\\n- Other features match the names and e-mail addresses of particular people who\\n  were posting at the time.\\n\\nWith such an abundance of clues that distinguish newsgroups, the classifiers\\nbarely have to identify topics from text at all, and they all perform at the\\nsame high level.\\n\\nFor this reason, the functions that load 20 Newsgroups data provide a\\nparameter called **remove**, telling it what kinds of information to strip out\\nof each file. **remove** should be a tuple containing any subset of\\n``(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\')``, telling it to remove headers, signature\\nblocks, and quotation blocks respectively.\\n\\n  >>> newsgroups_test = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'test\\',\\n  ...                                      remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\'),\\n  ...                                      categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(pred, newsgroups_test.target, average=\\'macro\\')\\n  0.77310...\\n\\nThis classifier lost over a lot of its F-score, just because we removed\\nmetadata that has little to do with topic classification.\\nIt loses even more if we also strip this metadata from the training data:\\n\\n  >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\',\\n  ...                                       remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\'),\\n  ...                                       categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform(newsgroups_train.data)\\n  >>> clf = MultinomialNB(alpha=.01)\\n  >>> clf.fit(vectors, newsgroups_train.target)\\n  MultinomialNB(alpha=0.01, class_prior=None, fit_prior=True)\\n\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(newsgroups_test.target, pred, average=\\'macro\\')\\n  0.76995...\\n\\nSome other classifiers cope better with this harder version of the task.

Actually,\\nI am  bit puzzled too and a bit relieved. However, I am going to put an end\\nto non-PIttsburghers' relief with a bit of praise for the Pens. Man, they\\nare killing those Devils worse than I thought. Jagr just showed you why\\nhe is much better than his regular season stats. He is also a lot\\nfo fun to watch in the playoffs. Bowman should let JAgr have a lot of\\nfun in the next couple of games since the Pens are going to beat the pulp out of Jersey anyway. I was very disappointed not to see the Islanders lose the final\\nregular season game.          PENS RULE!!!\\n\\n\""

A glaring example of Greek barbarism.\\n\\nLet us  now listen to the  relating of the said  incident told by\\nMr. Hasan  Yusuf Gudum, an  eye witness, who himself  was wounded\\nduring the same terrible event.\\n\\n\"On the night of the 24th  of December, 1963 my wife Feride Hasan\\nand I were paying a visit to the family of Major Dr. Nihat Ilhan.\\nOur neighbours  Mrs. Ayshe of  Mora, her daughter Ishin  and Mrs.\\nAyshe\\'s  sister Novber  were also  with us.  We were  all sitting\\nhaving supper.  All of  a sudden bullets  from the  Pedieos River\\ndirection started to riddle the  house, sounding like heavy rain.\\nThinking  that   the  dining-room  where  we   were  sitting  was\\ndangerous, we  ran to  the bathroom and  toilet which  we thought\\nwould be  safer. Altogether we were  nine persons. We all  hid in\\nthe bathroom  except my wife  who took  refuge in the  toilet. We\\nwaited in fear. Mrs. Ilhan the wife of Major Doctor, was standing\\nin the bath with her three children Murat, Kutsi and Hakan in her\\narms. Suddenly with  a great noise we heard the  front door open.\\nGreeks had  come in and were  combing, every corner of  the house\\nwith  their machine  gun bullets.  During these  moments I  heard\\nvoices saying, in  Greek, \"You want Taksim eh!\"  and then bullets\\nstarted flying in the bathroom. Mrs. Ilhan and her three children\\nfell into  the bath. They were  shot. At this moment  the Greeks,\\nwho broke  into the bathroom, emptied  their guns on us  again. I\\nheard one of the Major\\'s children moan, then I fainted.\\n\\nWhen I came  to myself 2 or  3 hours later, I saw  Mrs. Ilhan and\\nher three children lying dead in the  bath. I and the rest of the\\nneighbours in the  bathroom were all seriously  wounded. But what\\nhad happened to my wife? Then I remembered and immediately ran to\\nthe  toilet, where,  in  the doorway,  I saw  her  body. She  was\\nbrutally murdered.\\n\\nIn the  street admist the  sound of  shots I heard  voices crying\\n\"Help, help. Is  there no one to save us?\"  I became terrified. I\\nthought that  if the Greeks came  again and found that  I was not\\ndead they would kill  me. So I ran to the  bedroom and hid myself\\nunder the double-bed.\\n\\nAn our  passed by. In the  distance I could still  hear shots. My\\nmouth was dry,  so I came out  from under the bed  and drank some\\nwater. Then I put  some sweets in my pocket and  went back to the\\nbathroom, which was exactly as I had left in an hour ago. There I\\noffered sweets  to Mrs. Ayshe,  her daughter and Mrs.  Novber who\\nwere all wounded.\\n\\nWe  waited in  the bathroom  until 5  o\\'clock in  the morning.  I\\nthought morning would never come.  We were all wounded and needed\\nto be taken  to hospital. Finally, as we could  walk, Mrs. Novber\\nand I, went  out into the street hoping to  find help, and walked\\nas far as Koshklu Chiftlik.\\n\\nThere, we met  some people who took us to  hospital where we were\\noperated on. When  I regained my consciousness I  said that there\\nwere more  wounded in the  house and  they went and  brought Mrs.\\nAyshe and her daughter.\\n\\nAfter staying three  days in the hospital I was  sent by plane to\\nAnkara  for  further treatment.  There  I  have had  four  months\\ntreatment but still I cannot use  my arm.

I hope to show that there\\nwas and is much room for a difference of opinion within the Order\\nitself, perhaps by testing the limits myself.\\n\\n\\nLet us examine this issue a bit more closely....\\n\\n\"In 1895, Karl Kellner (1850-1905), a wealthy Austrian industrialist\\nand paper chemist, as well as a high-grade Mason, founded the Ordo\\nTempli Orientis.  Kellner had traveled widely in the East, where he\\nmet three adepts who instructed him specific magical practices.  \\nKellner\\'s efforts to develop the Order were later assisted by Franz\\nHartmann, Heinrich Klein and Theodore Reuss, who had worked together\\nprior to joining the O.T.O.  The Order was first proclaimed in 1902\\nin Reuss\\'s Masonic publication, \\'Oriflamme\\'.  On Kellner\\'s death,\\nReuss succeeded him as Outer Head [O.H.O.].  The \\'Jubilee\\' edition of\\nthe \\'Oriflamme\\', published in 1912, announced that the Order taught\\nsecret of sexual magic.\\n \\n\"Theodore Reuss was an interesting character.  Born June 28, 1855 in\\nAugsburg, he entered Masonry in 1876.  He was a singer, journalist and\\npossibly a spy for the Prussian political police, infiltrating the Socialist\\nLeague founded by Karl Marx\\'s daughter and her husband.  Reuss was\\nlater associated with William Wynn Westcott, a leader of the Golden\\nDawn, who later introduced him to John Yarker.  Yarker chartered Reuss to\\nfound the Rites of Memphis and Mizraim in Germany.  After several\\nattempts to concretize various Masonic Rites, Reuss settled on the\\ndevelopment of the O.T.O.\\n\\n\"The Order experienced reasonably steady growth under Reuss\\' leadership.\\nFor example, he chartered Papus in France, Rudolph Steiner in Berlin\\nand H. Spencer Lewis in the USA.  In 1912, the historic meeting between\\nReuss and Crowley occurred.  Crowley wrote that Reuss came to him and\\naccused him of revealing Order secrets.  When Crowley looked at it afresh,\\nthe initiated interpretation of sexual magick unfolded itself to him for\\nthe first time.  Reuss appointed Crowley as Supreme and Holy King of all\\nthe English speaking world, and it was this authorization that he invoked\\nwhen publishing the material of the Equinox.\\n\\n\"Reuss resigned as Outer Head of the Order in 1922 after suffering a\\nstroke and named Crowley his successor.  All was well until 1925 when\\n_The Book of the Law_ was translated into German.  There was a break\\nin the continuity of the Order.  Manyk members split with the new O.H.O.\\nover the book, which Crowley was actively promulgating through the Order.\\nHe had earlier revise dthe Order rituals at Reuss\\'s request, deeply\\ninfusing the doctrines of the New Aeon revelation.\"\\n\\n_An Introduction to the History of the O.T.O._, by Ad Veritatem IX\\'\\n\\nWithin _Equinox III:10_, Edited by \\n  Hymenaeus Beta, Frater Superior, Rex Summus Sanctissimus,\\n    Caliph of the United States of America,\\n      Published by Samuel Weiser, 1990.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are many possible reasons that our Frater Superior included this\\nmaterial in _Equinox III:10_.  And this is the real point, is it not?\\nWhy did he wish to publish such things about the history of his own\\norganization?  Does he represent a dogmatic threat to the principle\\nof Thelema?  Or is he exercising his True Will and putting forth very\\ncomplex pictures with no easy answers?  A picture which leaves room\\nfor very many interpretations.\\n\\nIt is quite easy for me to see, for example, that all of O.T.O. derived\\nout of the dribble of faltering Masonry, purchased by clever hucksters\\nwith an ounce of courage and some writing ability to aid them.  And I\\ncan take that all the way down to our present Caliph, whose feeble\\nsupport of the \\'Law of Thelema\\' is laughable at best.\\n\\nWould I be thrown out of the Order for speaking in this way?  \\nWill I?  \\nI think not.\\nWhy?  Because my Frater will see it as a perspective, an interjection\\nI am using as an example.  My illustration shows that we may express things\\nin the context of a larger work and the true significance of this may be\\nquite difficult to apprehend at first.\\n\\nSo it may be with OTO and Merlinus X\\'.  Please look O.T.O. more carefully.\\nI do not support Reuss\\'s words myself, as I am not qualified to assess\\nthem, and I am critical of their pomposity.  If I who am a member of\\nthe Order take such a stand and am allowed to continue doing so, then\\nwhat can this say about the health of the Order?  Does it mean that\\nthe Order has \\'gone soft\\' and abandoned its moral principles?  Or\\ndoes it mean that it is strong in its ability to let the will of\\nuniversal kinship arise on its own, not shackled by some dogmatic\\nrequirement?  How shall we resolve these two possibilities?\\n\\n\\nI find a high calibre of individual associated with Ordo Templi Orientis.\\nThey are often quite intelligent and sometimes very well versed in arcane\\nor usual information.  They are quite often artists and geniuses.  \\nHaving met some 20 longstanding members in the SF Bay Area (many who are or\\nwere very heavily involved with the Order), I can vouch for the integrity\\nof the organization as it stands.\\n\\nI have sometimes questioned the policy of Hymenaeus Beta.  In these moments \\nI followed my intuition, and I\\'ve found little to stop me from requesting\\na Second initiation from a different O.T.O. body.  I\\'m happily participating\\nin social groups (Feasts or Initiations) and have come to know the Gnostic\\nMass well enough for my tastes.\\n \\n\\nThis doesn\\'t make me an authority on Order politics and explanations, however.\\nI can only hypothesize and relay to you what I understand based on my\\nlimited contact with other members.\\n\\nI urge you not to take the words of Merlinus X too far.  There are many\\nways to interpret words, and many people who have become involved with\\nthe Order feel very strongly about the sanctity of personal freedom\\nand the preservation of individual vision.\\n\\nI welcome other comment on this issue and will be writing more in response\\nto other posts in this thread.\\n\\n\\nInvoke me under my stars.

A certain number of them actually are threatened. There are\\nimmediate threats, the things that women will tell you they\\'re afraid\\nof. The noise downstairs at night. The lonely walk to the car. The\\nstranger at the door. The abusive husband, finally kicked out of the\\nhouse as he threatens to hurt her and their children. The burglar... The\\nmugger...the rapist. \\n\\nAnd what are we told is the solution? Move. Get a dog. Keep the door\\nlocked. Call the police. as a next-to-last resort, learn martial arts. and\\nalways, there\\'s the implied question \"what\\'s a pretty little thing like\\nyou doing without a husband around to protect you?\\n\\nBut what if you don\\'t like dogs? Like living alone? Don\\'t have 10\\nyears to devote learning judo?\\n\\nWhat if, after examining the facts, a woman learns that \"rape victims\\nusing armed resistance were less likely to have the rape completed -\\nand were less likely to be injured(Kleck,124) than those using any\\nother form of resistance (Kleck,126) (also true for\\nrobbery/assault)(Kleck,123) \\n\\nWhat if, to our horror and despair, we find that citizens cannot depend\\non the police for effective protection - they usually respond after a\\ncrime has been committed. In truth, the Supreme Court has held that\\nthe police are not responsible for protecting any individual, only the\\nwhole community.\\n\\nAs a society, are we going to ask women, once again, to sacrifice\\nthemselves? Are we going to continue to deny women the ability to\\nhelp themselves?\\n\\nHere\\'s a thought. Neil Smith, in his book The Probability Broach, says\\n\"no 220 pound thug can threaten the well being or dignity of a 110-\\npound woman who has two pounds of iron to even things out.\" But if\\na woman decides to protect herself, with the easiest, most efficient\\nmeans possible, people - especially other women - are horrified.\\n\"Eughh, how could you? I\\'d be terrified!\" they ask. How could you\\nhurt someone? They\\'ll repeat the lie: it\\'ll just get taken away from\\nyou. In truth, 1% of \"defensive gun uses\" result in the offender taking\\nthe gun away from the victim.(122,Kleck)\\n\\nWell, despite the lies, and the social pressure, some of us have already\\nmade that hard choice. We\\'ve decided that we are not going to be\\nvictimized by the muggers, burglars or rapists. We\\'re buying more\\nguns than every before. We\\'re learning how to use them - and teaching\\nothers, women and men, how to use them. Most importantly, we are\\npreparing ourselves mentally to use our firearms for our own defense.\\nWe\\'re taking our own security, literally, into our own hands. We\\'re\\ngoing to stop begging and pleading and marching and WHAT WE\\nINTEND IS TO REALLY TAKE BACK THE NIGHT.\\n\\nBut there\\'s another threat, more insatiable than any mugger, more\\nsecretive than any burglar, more soul-destroying than any rapist.\\n\\nThat menace is government, and it threatens us all. We know that\\ngovernments, throughout time, have suppressed rights and oppressed\\npeople. It\\'s the way they survive.\\n\\nIn our names and with our money, it interferes with innocent people\\nboth at home and abroad. It lies to us, cheats us, steals from us and\\nthreatens us with violence. No one knows exactly what it\\'ll do next -\\nwhat freedom we will lose because some government goon decides\\n\"it\\'s for your own safety\" or \"we know best\". Any person who acted\\nlike government does would be psychoanalyzed within an inch of his\\nlife and locked up as a habitual offender.\\n\\nBut this monster called government persists, and grows. And we, who\\nshould be its masters, have become its unwilling slaves. Do you doubt\\nme? Then why did you file your income tax? \\n\\nLike any reasonable person, I believe that being afraid of something\\nthat can hurt you is smart, and that paranoia isn\\'t crazy if someone\\'s\\nreally after you. And make no mistake, they\\'re after you and they\\'re\\nafter me. Their names are familiar: Brady and Reynolds, Groff,\\nMetzenbahm, Moynihan, and Clinton. If we\\'re lucky, they\\'ll settle for\\nour assault rifles, our shotguns, our handguns and our ammunition. \\n\\nAs citizens, we have only two choices. They are the same two choices\\ngiven to women: to surrender or to fight. \\n\\nSurrender leads to the gulag, to the genocide of Pol Pot, to the\\ndisappearances, to Dachau. I do not intend to surrender. \\n\\nA battle can be philosophical or political: in the main, the people keep\\nthe government honest by threatening to vote it out of office. But if\\nthey have to, they will keep in mind the words of Thomas Jefferson:\\n\"the tree of liberty must be well watered with the blood of patriots.\"\\n\\nAs a patriot, I will point out the error in the government\\'s ways. I will\\ndo my best to vote the villains out of office. I will protest, and write,\\nand speak, and teach our children justice, honor and truth. And always\\nremember that Rebellion can lead to Bunker Hill and Saratoga......or it\\ncan lead to Tiananmen Square. \\n\\nWhen the time comes to stand up, if I have to give my life to keep\\nthem from going too far, if there is a Tiananmen Square in our future,\\nI intend to be there. And no matter what lies they tell and no matter\\nwhat laws they pass, I intend to meet them with something more\\nsubstantial in my hand than a brick. \\n\\nMy opinions are, of course, my own.\\n\\n',\n",

I got it from\\na The Morning Star, and am posting it with the permission of the\\neditor.\\n\\n\\n    Saint Aloysius Gonzaga\\n\\n    The Patron of Youth\\n\\n\\n    The marquis Gonzaga had high aspirations for his son, the  Prince\\n    Gonzage.  He  wanted  him  to become a famous, brave and honoured\\n    soldier. After all, he must carry on the  great  family  name  of\\n    Gonzaga.  Of  course, he was to become far more famous, brave and\\n    honoured than his father could ever have imagined; though not  in\\n    the manner expected.\\n\\n    Saint Aloysius\\' mother was a woman who received immense joy  from\\n    praying  to  God  and  meditating on the divine mysteries and the\\n    life of Our Lord. She had little time for the pleasures  of  this\\n    life.  As  Saint  Aloysius\\tgrew, he began to resemble his mother\\n    more than his father.\\n\\n    Saint Aloysius had learned numerous expressions from his father\\'s\\n    soldiers,  but the moment he discovered that they were vulgar, he\\n    fainted from shock. This shows his immense hatred of sin (What an\\n    example for us of the contempt we must have for sin).\\n\\n    About the time of his First Holy  Communion  (which  he  received\\n    from  the  Archbishop  of  Milan,  Charles Borromeo, whom himself\\n    became a great Saint), he con-secrated  his  purity  to  God  and\\n    asked the Blessed Virgin to protect his innocence for life.\\n\\n    He wanted to share Our Lord\\'s suffering to\\tshow  his  reciprocal\\n    love.  He  started by denying his passions; he avoided eating the\\n    finest foods, wearing the best clothes, and would put  pieces  of\\n    wood  in his bed in order to mortify himself for the love of God.\\n    While he was in his early teens his  father  sent  him  (and  his\\n    younger  brother)  to  the court of the Spanish King, Phillip 11.\\n    Obediently, he set out to make the best of it. He mixed  in  well\\n    with  the people of the royal court, for he was handsome, polite,\\n    intelligent and always had something interesting to say.\\n\\n\\n    Not long before this time, the great soldier-saint,  Saint\\tIgna-\\n    tius  of  Loyola,  had founded the Society of Jesus (the Jesuits)\\n    towards which Saint Aloysius\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t  -12-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    began to have a yearning. When he finally told  his  father,  the\\n    marquis flew into a rage and forbade his son to become a priest.\\n\\n    After a short time, his father sent him to the  great  cities  in\\n    order that he be tempted away from the priesthood, but even\\n\\n    through these trials, Saint Aloysius grew in his desire  for  the\\n    religious life and was strengthened in the virtue of purity.\\n\\n    The Marquis\\' plans were obviously failing, so he con-fronted  his\\n    son:  \"Will  you or will you not obey me and forget this foolish-\\n    ness?\" \"I will not, father,\" was the  in-evitable  reply.\\t\"Then\\n    leave from my sight and don\\'t return until you change your mind!\"\\n    With tears clouding his eyes, the Saint left the  room  to\\tpray:\\n    \"Tell  me Lord, what am I to do? Tell me! Tell me!\" He knelt down\\n    to flagellate himself as he had done several  times  before,  but\\n    this  time\\the was seen. The onlooker rushed to the marquis. This\\n    at last brought the proud man to his senses. \"The Lord wants him,\\n    the Lord can have him.\" He gave his consent for his son to become\\n    a Jesuit.\\n\\n    After some years (at the end of the sixteenth century), a  terri-\\n    ble  epidemic  broke out in Rome. All the hospitals were full and\\n    could house no more, so the Jesuits opened their own. Saint Aloy-\\n    sius  did  all he could in the hospitals, particularly to prepare\\n    the dying for a holy death.\\n\\n    Saint Aloysius himself contracted the plague  from\\tcarrying  and\\n    nursing  the  sick.  For three months he lay with a burning fever\\n    and finally, on June 21st, 1591, he gave his  soul\\tto  the  Lord\\n    while gazing at a crucifix.\\n\\n    Let us invoke Saint Aloysius as our patron and imitate him in his\\n    humility, purity and confidence in prayer.\\n\\n    Saint Aloysius Gonzaga, pray for us.\\n\\n    - Brendan Arthur\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    Prayer is as necessary to a person consecrated to the service  of\\n    others as a sword is to a soldier\\n\\nGod Bless\\n\\nFrom Simon\\nLines:  106\\n-- \\n/----------------------------------------------------------------|-------\\\\\\n|  Simon P.

It is a '75 850-T. The tires that\\nwere on it when I just bought it are old and cracked. I do not have an\\nowners manual for it (yet), but the tires listed in the Haynes manual are:\\nFront, 3,50 H 18 ; Rear 4.10 H 18, and pressures recommended are 26 front and\\n33 rear. Oddly, the pressure for the same tire on the T-3 is listed at 29 psi\\ninstead. Anyone know the reason? As I know though, the pressure I should run\\nat is that recommended by the manufacturer of the new tires I purchase.\\n\\nThe real question I have is this. The old tires that are on the bike are for\\nthe front, a Metzler Touring Special, 4.10 H 18, and for the rear an Avon\\nRoadrunner 4.70 H 18, (120/90) H 18 as marked on each tire. Both are larger\\nthan that listed in the Haynes Manual. What does the owners manual recommend,\\nand was it common to go up one size for this bike? Also, this will be my first\\nmotorcycle with innertubes. Any comments on the various manufacturers inner\\ntube qualities?\\n\\nThe above sizes are inches (except for the additional mark on the current\\nrear tire). What is the best metric match? The local BMW dealer thought\\n100/90 H 18 on the front and 120/90 H 18 on the back. He also happens to be\\nvery good at getting close to matching mail order prices.\\n\\nI am thinking of going with a Metzler ME33 Laser (possibly Comp K) on the\\nfront and ME88 on the back, both in MBS variety if possible (the longer \\nlasting belting system). I already use the ME33 on both the Vision and\\nFJ for the front, and like it, and I thought that with the shaft drive\\nbehavior and torque from the Guzzi that the ME88 might give more predictable\\nback end control and sliding behavior than a ME55 might, as well as giving\\nmuch better tire milage life. Any comments?\\n\\nA friend told me he thought that my bike had Boranni rims which are very\\ngood, but are relatively soft and have delicate sidewalls. I do not wish to\\nmount the tires myself this first time, so aside from warning the shop to be\\ncareful, any other comments I should make? I havn't looked at the rim to\\ncheck out the make yet, if it is marked. He just told me late yesterday and\\nI havn't had a chance to check the rim type.\\n\\nOn another note. I will remove the ugly (but in good shape....anyone want it?)\\nVetter fairing, and I will run without a windscreen for a while, but eventually\\nI would like a simple rounded cafe' style quarter fairing for it. It could be\\nfork/handlebar mounted. Any suggestions? Is there such a thing as a frame\\nmounted quarter fairing of the cafe' style for this bike? How about lower\\nbars/clip-ons for it? I would like to restore the bike into a good condition\\nrunner with a few modern updates, but while not being historically exactly\\naccurate still have it reflect relatively well a representation of the cafe'\\nstyle. (Yes I know to be picky, that period really predates this bike....it is\\njust that this bike has such potential for _that_ look.)\\n\\n-----------------------------Edward Walsh----Hewlett-Packard Company-------\\n                             edw@boi.hp.com  Disk Memory Division, MS475\\n                             (208)323-2174   P.O.

My Autobahn knowledge is admittedly second-hand, but I believe\\n>the following to be true:\\n\\nMy knowledge about driving in the U.S. is also second-hand, but I think I can\\ncorrect your statements about our Autobahn:\\n\\n>1. Drivers are much better disciplined in Europe than they are here.\\n\\nOh yeah, that would be paradise... in fact, you can forget it. From all I\\'ve\\nheard from my U.S. relatives, drivers esp. here in Germany are much more agg-\\nressive, but not disciplined. One of my relatives, a L.A. resident, hired a car\\nat the Nuernberg airport and went about 18 miles to our home. He said then that\\nhe grew about 1 year older during this ride and swore he\\'d never drive a car in\\nGermany again (this was in 1982 and he kept his promise - the situation now is\\neven worse as effect of the increased volume of traffic).\\nWhat you mean by `better disciplined\\' should perhaps be considered `cautious due\\nto fear\\': \\nWhen driving around here, you always *have* to take into consideration that the\\nmajority of the other drivers absolutely relies on you: They expect that nobody\\nfails or sleeps; many of them exploit this by driving as fast as their car can\\ngo (of course only where that is allowed, you might think - dream on :).\\nSo any mistake you make is a very high risk to your health - and if you\\'re ex-\\nposed to such a situation from your very first day as a driver, you learn to\\nhandle it - or you lose... \\nThat\\'s the way I and most people I know experience our traffic situation - \\nwhether you think this is pleasant or efficient is up to you; I think we handle\\na very high volume of traffic and that at high speeds with modest (compared to\\nthe volume) and decreasing rates of lethal accidents - OTOH, more and more\\npeople (esp. women) dislike driving (because they feel overtaxed and threatened)\\nand each accident is one accident too much.\\n\\n>2. The roads comprising the Autobahn are much better designed than\\n>   they are here, and usually include animal fences.  This makes them\\n>   far more predictable than most US highways.\\n\\nBetter designed and maintained, may be - but animal fences are very rare. Auto-\\nbahnen and many other streets have guard-rails (I hope that\\'s the right word - \\na plank made from thick steel sheet fixed on uprights; it\\'s about 2 feet high);\\nthose guard-rails are designed for keeping vehicles on the road. Smaller animals\\ncan crawl under the plank, bigger ones can easily jump over it. The point is\\nthat esp. larger animals are very rare in Germany; they tend also to be very\\ntimid. Accidents caused by animals are a neglegible danger.\\n\\n>3. Not all of Europe is the Autobahn.  Most places in Europe have\\n>   speed limits that aren\\'t out-of-line with what we used to have in\\n>   the US -- if my friends weren\\'t lying to me they\\'re typically not\\n>   much higher than 120km/h.\\n\\nYou\\'re right (there are speed linits even on the major part of the Autobahn) -\\nbut the attitude towards driving (see above) seems to be very similar to that\\nin Germany (I\\'ve been in France, Switzerland, Italy, Austria, Spain, Belgium,\\nthe Netherlands) - besides that, you really can\\'t rely on the residents abiding\\nthe local speed limits. I\\'ve got quite a lot of practise (~120k miles) and I\\'m\\nused to travel at 130 mph (FYI, with a car even smaller than a rabbit), but I\\nconsider driving on the highways round Paris or Milano really a thrill...\\n\\n>I strongly suspect you won\\'t find a lot of Rabbit owners doing 120mph\\n>(nearly 200km/h) on the Autobahn, but I could be wrong. ...\\n\\nSorry, but you\\'ll find quite a lot rabbit-class-car (or even smaller, mine is a\\nPeugeot 205) owners going that fast; small cars with much HP are very `hip\\' over\\nhere - and most people buying such cars aren\\'t afraid to let them run.\\n\\n>                                                      ...  Some people\\n>have no respect for their own lives.\\n\\nI disagree; the size or weight of a car is rather irrelevant. Formula-1 cars\\nweigh less than 700 kg and the drivers have a chance to survive accidents at\\n130 mph or higher - OTOH when crashing against a solid object at 130 mph,\\nit makes no difference whether you sit in a Porsche, a Mercedes, a tank or on\\na bicycle: Your\\'re dead.\\n\\nBye,\\nStefan\\n---\\nStefan Dalibor (dalibor@immd3.uni-erlangen.de)\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\"...And now for the next case in Kangaroo Court, I accuse you of being the\\nreincarnation of Adolf Hitler.

No, Jesus knew His mission was to redeem all (Jew &\\nGentile) people and establish His kingdom in the hearts of those\\nwho would believe.

For example, a crowbar, hammers,\\nscrewdrivers, and such can be regarded as \\'burglar tools\\' pretty much\\nat the whim of the authorities, based primarily on the individual\\npossessing them in the car, etc. not being in a trade that makes routine\\nuse of these tools.  In a like manner, one who has no \\'legitimate need\\'\\n(gov\\'t definition) for strong crypto software or systems, and is caught\\nusing them, might find themselves in possession of \\'terrorist tools\\'.\\nIn other words, if one is not working for a corporation with extremely\\nsensitive commercial data that warrants (in the Fed\\'s opinion) strong\\nsecurity, or a government agency, and securing only work-related data,\\nnot personal data, one will most likely be nailed on this if discoverd.\\nA personal desire for \\'privacy\\' most certainly will not be regarded as\\na \\'legitimate NEED\\': \\n\"Why do you want such strong security, especially from \\'legitimate law\\nenforcement\\'?

Decibels are all *ratios.* The question that remains in\\nany ratio is the reference unit used. Sometimes, this will be a reference\\npower, such as 1 milliwatt (given a certain circuit impedance which\\nshould also be included in the fine print or known, like 50 ohms\\nin an RF circuit of that impedance), leading to an accepted\\nnotation of dBm. Maybe it might be dBV, disregarding the impedance of\\nthe circuit and power developed, using 1 volt as reference *amplitude*\\n(rather than reference power). Or, it might have an arbitrary or omitted\\nreference that is not included in the notation, leading to just plain dB.\\nSo. look at it this way--'dB' has an implied reference while notation\\nsuch as 'dBm' has an explicit reference.\\n\\nFor power:\\n\\n  dB = 10*log( P(measured)/P(reference) )\\n\\nFor amplitude\\n\\n  dB = 20*log( A(measured)/A(reference) )\\n\\n'B' is for bel, which is a standard term for a log ratio to the base\\n10, named after Alexander Graham Bell. A 'deci' Bel is 1/10 of a bel.\\nIt has nothing to do with the Bell Telephone company except for\\nthe common founder's name. The small 'd'/large 'B' is per SI notation\\nconvention. I don't know anyone that's been crucified for messing it up.\\n\\nCommon references for audio are:\\n\\n\\t0 dBm = 1 milliwatt across 600 ohms\\n\\t0 dBV = 1 volt\\n\\n\\t0 VU (a zero on the VU meter) = +4 dBm  (pro gear line level)\\n\\t0 VU = -10dBV\\t(consumer gear line level)\\n\\n\\nOften times, a power amp VU meter will be aligned using\\nthe rated power of the amp as the 0 dB point. It is all\\ndone to whatever reference is reasonable for the application\\nor moment.\\n\\nNote that in a circuit with a given (and maybe unknown) linear\\nimpedance, if the amplitude goes up so many decibels, the\\npower will also increase the same amount. This proof can be done\\nwith the above two identities and ohm's law.\\n\\n-- \\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\n       Dave Medin\\t\\t\\tPhone:\\t(205) 730-3169 (w)\\n    SSD--Networking\\t\\t\\t\\t(205) 837-1174 (h)\\n    Intergraph Corp.\\n       M/S GD3004 \\t\\tInternet: dtmedin@catbyte.b30.ingr.com\\n  Huntsville, AL 35894\\t\\tUUCP:  ...uunet!ingr!b30!catbyte!dtmedin\\n\\n   ******* Everywhere You Look (at least around my office) *******\\n\\n * The opinions expressed here are mine (or those of my machine)\\n\",\n",

France Magazine\\'s Summer 1992 edition\\nhas a fantastic presentation of their basic insurance coverage,\\nincluding a sample chart of copayment percentages.  For 1-30 days,\\nyou\\'re covered for 80% of the public hospital rate, 100% afterward.\\nWith extra private insurance, you can get into a private hospital and\\nbe covered for any differences beyond the public hospital rate.  The\\npublic insurance covers 100% beyond 30 days, or the same cash amount\\nfor a private hospital and the difference is paid out-of-pocket or\\naccording to your supplementary private insurance.  Over 2/3rds of\\nFrench have some form of extra private insurance.  So, 30% of health\\ncosts in Europe are out of private funds and not gleaned from other\\ntaxes.  The GDP figures are combined public and private expenditures\\nfor total outlay using the same methods that yield the 13-14% figure\\nfor the U.S.\\n\\nThat the French had deductibles and copayments in their insurance fund\\nis to their credit ... I am in the minority for advocating such back\\nin Canada (to make the Canadian insurance look more like real health\\ninsurance -- which actually it is).  The new Reform Party, a breakoff\\nof traditionalists from the Conservatives with a mildly \"libertarian\"\\nfaction, hold our public health insurance as an untouchable but that\\njust a few people have to be reminded that it\\'s not free (the average\\nCanadian/European is more fiscally naive than their American\\ncounterparts on issues like these).\\n\\nI\\'m one of the few people who favour copayments (forget about\\nleftists, even our conservatives attack me for it on the Canadian\\nnewsgroups) to make it look more like real insurance, \\'cos the 100%\\ninsurance payment is hidden (unlike in France) and if you didn\\'t know\\nit, you\\'d believe it actually is socialized medicine (American\\nconservatives/libertarians and Canadian leftists are the only ones who\\nseriously call it that).  Canadians aren\\'t worried about the\\nAmericans, who spend 14%; we\\'re worried about the French and Germans\\nwho spend 7% to our 9% ... so the insurance is looking at things that\\nshouldn\\'t be paid for out of general funds like physicals for\\ninsurance policies, sick notes, electrolysis, etc.  The reason that\\nthe Canadian health insurance hasn\\'t spiralled out of control despite\\nbeing open and universal is that unlike Americans, there is no urge to\\nspend all of your benefits\\' worth, and more if you can ... we\\'re a\\ndifferent culture.\\n\\n>Like the play or pay model, managed competition leaves in place two \\n>elements of the current health care system that reformers most often \\n>criticize: the private, for-profit insurance industry; and the \\n>employer-based system of coverage.

It is all pure insurance without HMO\\'s.  The divisions\\nare different, with the Germans using a couple hundred interlinked\\n\"sickness funds\" over a century old while Canada divides by their\\nprovinces (who run the insurance fund and set local fees with the\\ndoctors monopoly; federal funds cover the fees disbursed.)\\n\\nWith such an open-ended system, it\\'s no surprise that Canada is #2 to\\nthe U.S. in costs; all-insurance is the most expensive way to go.

It\\'s one\\nof those technically accurate phrasings that conveys the wrong impression.\\nWhat Mr. Quiqley is more than aware of, I\\'m sure, is that when people\\nread this they think violent arguments where one member of the family\\ngrabs a gun and shoots another, thereby creating a tragic situation\\nwhich could easily have been avoided had the gun not been there, or\\na tragic accident, especially involving a child.\\n\\n       Unfortunately, that\\'s not the way things stack up.  The majority\\nof that 43 \"times\" (37 I believe) are suicides.  That is, someone \\nintentionally took a firearm and shot themselves intending to kill \\nthemselves.  And why it\\'s popular to try and blame suicides on guns,\\nthe evidence doesn\\'t support this.  Internal studies, as well as\\ncomparative studies with other countries, indicate that cultural\\nfactors far outweigh whether a person will kill themselves or not.\\n(Japan, for instance, has a slightly higher rate than the U.S.  There\\npeople jump off buildings.)\\n\\n       According to the National Crime Survey, 40% of violent crime\\nis commited by \"non-strangers,\" which mistakenly has been generalized\\nregarding the King County study to mean, \"Friends and family.\"  That\\nis, Mr. Quigley, and others who quote this statistic, are banking on\\nthe mental image that a \"Friend, family member, or child,\" equates\\nto a loving relationship, and that it was cut short in a moment of\\nanger.  Unfortunately, all too often husbands beat and kill wives,\\nchildren assault parents, or vice-versa.  Most rapes are commited by \\nsomeone known to the victim, for instance.  Essentially, that a gun\\nwas used against a \"friend\" or family member doesn\\'t mean they\\nweren\\'t trying to hurt the other person.  Crime is highest among\\npoor urban families, and those are also the areas most \"at risk\"\\nfor family problems, especially violent ones.  A son in a gang may\\nnot be as loving toward his parents if they disapprove than a suburban\\nkid might.\\n\\n       Finally, it hinges on the fallacy that a dead intruder is the\\nonly value of a self-defense firearm.  Using the minimum figures I\\nworked out using the NCS I got about an 80:1 ratio between deadly\\nself-defenses (justifiable homicides) and with-gun self-defenses.\\nBetween the FBI Uniform Crime report and the NCS there\\'s an enormous\\namount of data and anybody with the calculator can crunch the numbers.\\nAs such it is incorrect to assume that a dead body is the only valid\\nmeans of determining the success of such a defense, since according\\nto the NCS (which has been considered by many to seriously under-report\\ndefenses) there were far more successful with-gun defenses than intruders\\nkilled.\\n\\n       Not it also confines itself to the home, where attack by a \"friend\\nor family member\" is far, far more likely, and excludes any defense\\nwhich occurs outside the home.  (I believe a large number occur in\\nbusinesses.)\\n\\n>Studies by the \\n>Western Psychiatric Institute, in Pittsburgh, found that the mere presence\\n>of a gun in the home sharply incresases the likelihood a family member\\n>will commit suicide, even in the absence of psychiatric illness.\"\\n\\n       I have not seen the exact data for this, so I can\\'t comment.  I\\nwill point out Canada\\'s and Japan\\'s suicide rate as indications that\\nculture far more than firearm availability affect suicide rates.\\n\\n       There was also a comparative study between Canada (for what\\nit\\'s worth, considering the difficulty of comparing across cultural\\nlines) published in the New England Journal of Medicine (I can get the\\nexact cite if you need it) that concluded that restrictive firearm laws \\nwould not significantly impact the over-all suicide rate.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nDavid Veal Univ. of Tenn.

ESPN had\\nprior contracts to baseball to show Monday night games and had\\ncontracted all the other bs shows well in advance.  The NHL TV deal\\nwas very late in the scheduling process (you normally have to do this\\none-plus year out.  The NHL package was finished two weeks before the\\nseason started).  ESPN has shown tremendous commitment to the NHL by\\nsqueezing in extra telecasts when it could (like the last Minnesota\\ngame) and putting Stanley Cup games as backup to their baseball\\ntelecasts (which by favorable circumstances they could pull off last\\nnight).\\n\\nBut the bottom line is that ESPN cannot break contracts at will.

A few years ago, I did some calculations on a\\n\"Grand Tour\" space probe launched by a Saturn V in 1975-76. At the time,I felt \\nthat\\nthe idea of a big \"mother ship\" had some merit - the Voyagers had to be rather\\nsmall, lightweight craft due to the limitations imposed by using weak Titan\\nIII/Centaur launchers. The concept I examined (and Michael\\'s?) had a lot in\\ncommon with the British Interplanetary Society\\'s Daedalus project for sending a\\nprobe to Barnard\\'s Star - i.e. a large \"bus\" spacecraft carrying several\\nsmaller probes to be dispatched when the ship arrives at its destination.\\nThe Saturn V supposedly would have been able to launch a 10-ton payload towards\\nJupiter and beyond. The \"bus\" could have included far more powerful\\ncameras/telescopes/scientific equipment and a heavier/more powerful power\\nsource than the Voyagers as there would be no limitations on weight anymore.\\nExtremely important as the Voyagers had to perform most of their measurements\\nwithin a couple of weeks before and after planetary encounter, and usually at a\\nrelatively great distance.\\n---\\nThe smaller probes carried aboard might have been based on the \"real\" Voyagers,\\nand an even smaller version like the one scheduled for launch towards Pluto in\\nthe early 21st century, and would have been released at various points during\\nthe mission. The advantages are obvious: the bus would have carried out the\\nsame basic Jupiter-Saturn-Uranus-Neptune mission than Voyager 2 did, but in\\naddition two \"sub-probes\" could have been relased at Saturn, examining\\nthat planet\\'s south polar regions before moving on to Pluto. This would have\\nenabled NASA to map both hemispheres of Pluto/Charon by 1986...and several\\nother probes could have examined parts of the Jupiter/Saturn/Uranus/Neptune\\nsystems that weren\\'t examined in great detail by the Voyagers due to\\ntrajectory-related factors. A small \"swarm\" of camera-equipped miniature space\\nprobes released a month before encounter would have been too costly for a \\nsmall Voyager-type mission but entirely feasible if launched from a heavy, \\nwell-equipped spacecraft. And would we have learned a lot more about the outer\\nplanets!

Kuwait was in \\nexistence since 1752. We continued to be in existence until the \\nconflict between the Ottoman Empire and the British and others in the \\narea. Thereafter, we signed with the British in 1899 a protective \\nagreement whereby the British guaranteed the sovereignty and security \\nof Kuwait.\\'\\' \\n\\n``In 1913, the British and the Ottoman signed an agreement defining \\nwithout any doubt the borders of Kuwait as they stand today. Such an \\nagreement was reconfirmed in 1932 between the Kuwaiti government \\nand the Iraqi government at that time. That is when Iraq became a state, \\nafter Kuwait itself.\\'\\' \\n\\n``In 1961, when we declared our independence Iraq seized the \\nopportunity to claim Kuwait as part of Iraq. There were threats. The \\nBritish came in, and Arab forces came in to guarantee the sovereignty \\nand territorial integrity of Kuwait. In 1963, Kuwait and Iraq again \\nsigned border agreement, thereby defining our territory and Iraq\\'s \\nrecognition to the sovereignty and territory of Kuwait.\\'\\' \\n\\n---Compiled by Firyal Alshalalbi \\n\\n\\nOrigins of Kuwait \\n\\nThe establishment of Kuwait is attributed to Barrak b. Ghurair of the \\nBani Khalid who used Kuwait as a summer residence. The beginning of \\nKuwait goes back to the late 17th century and some historians go \\nfurther up to 1611. Kuwait\\'s name is derived from al-Kut which means \\nfortress. Kuwait is also called Qurain, which is the diminutive of qarn, a \\nhorn or hill. Kuwait town flourished and grew since its \\nestablishment. \\n\\nThe \\'Utub, al-Sabah family is a branch of \\'Utub, settled in Kuwait \\nduring the early 18th century. They lived under the protection \\nof Bani Khalid until 1752. After that, they became independent and \\nSabah Bin Jabir was chosen as the first ruler for \\'Utub. \\n\\nCarsten Niebuhr (1733-1815) a Dutch explorer was among the first who \\nwrote about the Arabia. He was the mathematician in the scientific \\nexpedition sent in 1760 by the King of Denmark to Arabia. He \\ndocumented details of Arab tribes inhabiting both coasts of the Gulf \\nand in the case of Kuwait, he was the first writer to give the two \\nnames by which the town was known, Kuwait and Qurain. Niebuhr\\'s chart \\nof the Persian Gulf was the best one drawn before the end of that \\ncentury, see the map from Abu Hakima, History of Eastern Arabia \\n1750-1800. pub.1965. \\n\\nAl-Sabah (\\'Utub) kept good relations with other powers in the eastern \\nArabia. According to Ahmed Abu Hakima\\'s conclusions in his well \\ndocumented study about the history of eastern Arabia between 1750-1800, \\nthere was no Ottoman rule on the region. ``In the second half of \\nthe 18th century, there was no Ottoman ruler in Eastern Arabia. \\nIn fact, Ottoman rule was not even nominally acknowledged. Their \\nattempts to restore their lost position in al-Hasa through the \\ncampaign of Thuwayni in 1786, and Ali Pasha\\'s expedition against the \\nWahhabis in 1798, were unsuccessful. At Kuwait, the nearest point of \\nthe Utbi domains to the Ottoman Mutasallimiyya of Basra, the Shaikh \\nwas under no form of Ottoman control. The aim of \\'Utbi external policy \\nwas to keep on friendly relations with all the forces working in the \\nGulf.\\'\\' (p. 182-183) Abu Hakima continued in his conclusions that ``Kuwait \\nwas not a dependency of Basra, the Persian occupation of Basra \\n(1775-79) did not affect Kuwait.\\'\\' (p.183) \\n\\nKuwait had its own identity through the Ottoman domination on the Arab \\nworld. This identity was clear to the British and the French who \\ntried to win the support of Kuwait\\'s Sheikh between 1793-95 when the \\nBritish wanted his support in their conflict with the French in the \\nGulf area. \\n\\n--- \\n\\nIndependent Kuwait \\n\\nThis is the first of a series of articles that testify to the \\nindependence of Kuwait throughout its history from both Iraq and the \\nOttomans. \\n\\nThe following text is related to an expedition carried out by the \\nOttomans in 1871 against the Wahhabis in Eastern Arabia (where the oil fields \\nin Saudi Arabia now). Kuwait and its ruler at that time, Sheikh \\nAbdulla Ibn Sabah Ibn Jabir, allied themselves with the Turks:} \\n\\nAbdullah\\' role in the fighting was not a minor one. He joined the \\nexpedition as a commander of the large Kuwaiti fleet and was the first \\nto use its guns against the besieged town of Al-Qatif. Had it not been \\nfor this bombardment by the Kuwaiti fleet, Al-Qatif obviously would \\nnot have surrendered in a mere three hours. \\n\\nIn relation to this, a question arises as to why the Ottoman warships \\nrefrained from participating in the bombardment. The answer lies in \\nreports relating to the political movements that preceded accounts of \\nthe progress of the expedition. Because the Ottomans were unwilling to \\njeopardize the maritime peace imposed by Britain in the area,  the \\nSultan and the Pasha promised their warships would not be used in the \\nwar against Su\\'ud or any Sheikh in the war zone. Kuwait, which was not \\na party  to the above-mentioned treaty of 1861, was under no such \\nobligation especially since the expedition was not directed against \\nthose who had signed it. \\n\\n\\n[ From the above text, we can see that Kuwait was not part of the \\nOttomans or the British colonies. For more details about the mentioned \\nexpedition, please check out the source of the above text: \\n\\nThe Modern History of Kuwait, 1750--1965, by Ahmed Abu-Hakima, McGill \\nUniversity, Canada ] \\n\\n--- \\n\\nIndependent Kuwait--2 \\n\\nThis is another article of a series of articles that testify to the \\nindependence of Kuwait throughout its history from both Iraq and the \\nOttomans. \\n\\nThe following text discusses a dispute on an estate called Sufiyya in Zubair, \\nIraq, between the Sheikh of Kuwait and Al-Zuhair tribe in Zubair. \\n\\nIn 1866, trouble developed over the possession by Sheikh Sabah of the \\nestate which was [purchased] by his father, Sheikh Jabir, in 1836. This \\nproperty was sequestered by a Turkish Qa\\'immaqam [representative] on \\nthe basis of a claim by the Al-Zuhair that the vendor had been the \\nowner of a share and not of the n 100e Sufiyya. At the same time, \\nSheikh Sabah was required to expel from other lands owned by him at \\nthe island of Fao some cultivators who had immigrated from Persian \\nterritory. \\n\\nIt should be recalled that  the Turkish officials from the start \\nshowed strong prejudice in favor of the Zuhair claimants. Abdulla Ibn \\nSabah,  the eldest son of the ruler of Kuwait who went to Basra as his \\nfather\\'s agent in the case,  narrowly escaped being thrown  into jail \\nupon his refusal to make a payment amounting to the value of seven \\nyears produce which the Ottoman authorities deemed the plaintiffs were \\nentitled to receive. \\n\\nEventually, the dispute was settled by the Wali [Governor] of Baghdad \\nin favor of the Sheikh of Kuwait. The decision of the Governor of \\nBasra in favor of the Sheikh was apparently made for various reasons. \\nSome writers think that the Governor wanted to win Abdulla over to the \\nTurkish side, and suggest that the Governor, Namiq Pasha, even offered \\nhim the title of Qa\\'immaqam, which he declined. Nevertheless,  the \\nproceedings of the Turks in this case were regarded by the inhabitants \\nof Kuwait as attempts to cause a confrontation with Zubair. It seems \\nthat they had anticipated a conflict and according to reports by the \\nBritish Agent at Basra, the people of Kuwait were prepared to a man to \\nabandon their town rather than submit to Turkish rule. Lorimer suggests \\nthat the final order of Namiq Pasha, upholding the Kuwait Sheikh\\'s \\ntitle to Sufiyya, was perhaps due to a report that Sheikh Sabah, \\n``with the object of attacking Zubair if the decision should go \\nagainst him, had obtained a promise of countenance and armed support \\nfrom the Wahhabi Amir.\\'\\' \\n\\nIn addition to this legal matter with Zubair, Kuwait had had other \\nproblems with Basra whose courts tried to jail Abdulla Ibn Sabah, as \\nexplained above. However, Kuwait\\'s relations with the Ottoman \\nmutasallims of Basra had at times been amicable and in several \\ninstances, those mutasallims even sought refuge at Kuwait when \\npressured by the Pashas of Baghdad who exercised control over them. \\n\\n[ Source: The Modern History of Kuwait, 1750--1965, by Ahmed Abu-Hakima, \\nMcGill University, Canada ] \\n\\n--- \\n\\nIndependent Kuwait--3 \\n\\nThis is another article that testifies to the \\nindependence of Kuwait throughout its history from both Iraq and the \\nOttomans. \\n\\n\\nWhen Pelly [Colonel Pelly, the British Resident in the Gulf] visited Kuwait \\nfor the first time on March 3, 1863, he was \\nmet at Jahra by Sheikh Mubarak, the second son of the ruler, Sheikh \\nSabah. Just before he reached Kuwait town on March 4, he was met by \\nSheikh Abdulla, the eldest son and heir apparent, who accompanied him \\nto the town gate on their way to ``a very good home,\\'\\' which had been \\nprepared for Pelly and his companions. ``Scarcely had we entered it,\\'\\' \\nsays Pelly, ``when Sheikh Sabah himself came.\\'\\' \\nThis description of Pelly\\'s reception indicates that to a certain \\ndegree it was run according to protocol. \\n\\nThe government system of Kuwait and administration of justice were the \\nsubject of comments made by Pelly. ``The Government is patriarchal,\\'\\' \\nsays Pelly, ``the Sheikh managing the political, and the Cazee [Qadi] \\nthe judicial departments.

On October 30, Lieutenant Edmunds, the \\nAssistant Resident at Abu Shahr [in Iran], arrived in Kuwait on  a \\nspecial mission from the Resident, Captain Hennell. His mission was to \\nfind out if Kuwait was willing to welcome the establishment of a \\nBritish line of post across the desert from Kuwait to the \\nMediterranean. The British war vessel fired the usual salute in honor \\nof the Sheikh after it had anchored in the waters of Kuwait Bay. The \\nsalute was not acknowledged and Edmunds waited in the vessel for three \\ndays before he was able to communicate with the Sheikh. \\n\\nAfter Edmunds\\' return to Abu Shahr, both he and Captain Hennell \\nexplained this unusual behavior of the Sheikh, to have been due not \\nto ill-will, but principally to a desire to mislead the Egyptian agent \\nat Kuwait as to the nature of his relations with the British. \\nTherefore, they considered that Jabir\\'s conduct did not indicate any \\nchange in his friendly policies towards the British. \\n\\nIf the British tolerated the attitude of Jabir towards Edmunds, so \\nalso did the Egyptians. Earlier in the same year, some of the most \\nwanted men in the Wahhabi camp, such as \\'Umar Ibn \\'Ufaisan, the \\nWahhabi general  in Al-Hasa, and Wahhabi tribes like Al-Duwaish, \\nsought refuge in Kuwait. \\n\\nProtection of refugees seeking political \\nasylum in his country was a policy that had been adopted earlier by \\nSheikh Abdulla Ibn Sabah. This can, therefore, be looked upon as an \\nindication of self-confidence; an outcome of Kuwait\\'s independence \\nfrom foreign powers. It corroborates the fact that Kuwait, if \\nnecessary, was prepared to defend itself against more powerful \\nneighbors. \\n\\nThis defense depended not only on the walls of the city, but also on \\nbedouin tribes in its neighborhood and a merchant fleet equipped with \\nthe necessary guns comparable to other Arab fleets of the time. \\n\\nAs to Kuwait\\'s position between 1815 and 1839, one can safely state \\nthat it managed to maintain a neutral policy with regard to the \\nstruggling Wahhabis and Egyptians. Relations with the British  and \\neven with the Pasha of Baghdad continued on good terms. \\n\\n[ Source: The Modern History of Kuwait, 1750--1965, by Ahmed Abu-Hakima, \\nMcGill University, Canada ] \\n\\n--- \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  They were trying to recover land they believed \\n  was theirs, much like the Argentines in the Faulklands.

              " 'From: betz@gozer.idbsu.edu (Andrew Betz)\\nSubject: Randy Weaver trial update: Day 5.\\nNntp-Posting-Host: gozer\\nOrganization: SigSauer Fan Club \\nLines: 94\\n\\nNote: These trial updates are summarized from reports in the\\n_Idaho Statesman_ and the local NBC affiliate television\\nstation, KTVB Channel 7.\\n\\nRandy Weaver/Kevin Harris trial update: Day 5.\\n\\nMonday, April 19, 1993 was the fifth day of the trial.\\n\\nSynopsis: Government informant Kenneth Fadeley testified that\\nRandy Weaver sold him two shotguns in violation of the National\\nFirearms Act of 1934.  U.S. District Court Judge Edward Lodge\\nasks jurors not to hear accounts of the Waco fire because\\nof possible influences on the Weaver/Harris case.\\n\\nThe testimony of FBI Special Agent Greg Rampton apparently\\nended without further incident, as it was mentioned neither\\nby KTVB nor the _Idaho Statesman_.\\n\\nThe day was highlighted by the testimony of Kenneth Fadeley,\\nwho had been posing as an outlaw biker and illegal guns person\\nnamed Gus Magiosono.  Fadeley testified that he was acting as\\nan informant for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms\\nin his dealings with Randy Weaver.\\n\\nFadeley began by stating that he had met Weaver in 1987 at an\\nAryan Nations summer conference in Hayden Lake, Idaho.  The two\\nthen met again October 11, 1989 (note the huge separation in\\ntime) at a restaurant in Sandpoint, Idaho, to begin a weapons\\ntransaction.  He stated that Weaver had said, \"He felt like he\\n(Weaver) was being prepared to do something dangerous for the\\nWhite cause.\"\\n\\nThe two later met October 24, 1989 behind the restaurant and\\nlater went to a city park to make the sale.  During this second\\nmeeting, Fadeley was wearing a small recording device to\\ntape the conversation.  Weaver allegedly showed him an H&R 12-\\ngauge shotgun with a 13-inch barrel and an overall length of\\n19.25 inches.  He additionally showed a Remington 12-gauge\\nshotgun with a 12.75-inch barrel and an overall length of\\n24.5 inches (NFA requires minimums of 18 inches for barrel\\nlength and an overall length of 26 inches).  On tape, Weaver\\nis reported to have said that he could perform better work once\\nhis machine shop is set up.  The two then discuss the possibility\\nof future sales.  Fadeley then counts out three hundred dollars\\nfor the two guns and promises the balance of one-hundred fifty\\ndollars when they next meet.  (Note that the ATF could have\\nsimply arrested him here.  Why did they wait until January 1991 -\\nover a year later - to arrest him?  This is not explained).\\n\\nThe next meeting took place on Nov 30, 1989.  Fadeley stated that\\nhis \"source\" had only come up with one hundred dollars instead\\nof the one-hundred fifty he\\'d promised.  At this point, Weaver\\nsuspected he was dealing with an informant, \"I had a guy in\\nSpokane tell me you were bad.\"  Fadeley managed to convince\\nWeaver otherwise.\\n\\nThe _Idaho Statesman_ states explicitly that three tapes were\\nmade of conversations with Randy Weaver.  Thus, each of these\\nmeetings must have been recorded.  However, the _Statesman_ also\\nreported that a tape of a telephone conversation involving Vicki\\nWeaver (Randy Weaver\\'s wife) was played to the court.  There must\\nhave also been phone taps.\\n\\nThese tapes were played to the court via both headphones and\\nloudspeakers under the objections of Gerry Spence, Weaver\\'s\\nattorney.  Spence said to a KTVB reporter that he wanted to\\nmake sure that the government proved its case, \"...if it has a\\ncase at all...\" according to the rules.\\n\\nRandy Weaver tore off his headphones and wept when he heard his\\nwife\\'s voice on the tape.\\n\\nU.S. District Court Judge Edward Lodge asked jurors not to hear\\naccounts of the Waco fire because of possible influences on the\\nWeaver/Harris case.  Exactly how such information could affect\\nthis trial is not explained.\\n\\nOther notes: Sunday evening there was a report on KTVB concerning\\nKevin Harris.  Unnamed agents within the FBI admit that they are\\nsurprised that Kevin Harris is still alive.  First, they were\\nsurprised that he survived the initial gunshot wound(s) sustained\\nin the initial firefight at the Y-junction.  Later, when Randy\\nWeaver was struck by sniper fire the sniper had reported that\\nHarris had been struck (not Weaver).  Finally, there was a report\\nthat the FBI agent who killed Vicki Weaver believed he was aiming\\nat Kevin Harris instead.  (This is what was reported).  Critics\\nare charging that the FBI was blatantly trying to eliminate the\\nonly non-government witness to the deaths of Samuel Weaver and\\nDeputy Marshal William Degan.  Some local people believe that\\nHarris\\'s survival is simply due to divine intervention.\\n\\nTuesday, April 20, 1993 will be the sixth day of the trial. \\nKenneth Fadeley\\'s testimony is scheduled to continue. \\n\\n',\n",

A star tracking technique for optical\\nequipment calibration and satellite tracking technique for orbit\\nprediction improvement are also described. The accuracy of EGS\\ntracking data obtained by RRL at the request of NASDA is also\\ndiscussed. In addition, it is briefly demonstrated that the\\nposition of the Japanese amateur satellite (JAS-1) which was\\nlaunched with the EGS, was accurately determined by means of a      <----\\nsatellite tracking video. It is clear from this experiment that     <----\\noptical observation data (i.e., satellite direction data) are very  <----\\nuseful for satellite orbit determination during initial launch      <----\\nstages. Furthermore, the results confirm the effectivenes of these  <----\\ntwo satellite optical tracking techniques.                          <----\\n\\n\\nMU radar measurements of orbital debris\\nSATO, TORU; KAYAMA, HIDETOSHI; FURUSAWA, AKIRA; KIMURA, IWANE\\n(Kyoto University, Japan)\\nAIAA, NASA, and DOD, Orbital Debris Conference: Technical Issues and \\nFuture Directions, Baltimore, MD, Apr. 16-19, 1990. 10 p. \\nRPN: AIAA PAPER 90-1343\\n     Distributions of orbital debris versus height and scattering cross \\nsection are determined from a series of observations made with a high-\\npower VHF Doppler radar (MU radar) of Japan.

Unlike the conventional large \\nVHF radars, in which output power of a large vacuum tube is distributed \\nto individual antenna elements, each of 475 solid state power amplifier \\nfeeds each antenna element. This system configuration enables very fast \\nbeam steering as well as various flexible operations by dividing the \\nantenna into independent subarrays, because phase shift and signal \\ndivision/combination are performed at a low signal level using \\nelectronic devices under control of a computer network. The antenna \\nbeam can be switched within 10 microsec to any direction within the \\nzenith angle of 30 deg. Since a precise phase alignment of each element \\nis crucial to realize the excellent performance of this system, careful \\ncalibration of the output phase of each power amplifier and antenna \\nelement was carried out. Among various aircraft which may be used for \\nthis purpose artificial satellites have an advantage of being able to \\nmake a long term monitoring with the same system. An antenna pattern \\nmonitoring system for the MU radar was developed using the scientific \\nsatellite OHZORA (EXOS-C). A receiver named MUM (MU radar antenna \\nMonitor) on board the satellite measures a CW signal of 100 to 400 \\nwatts transmitted from the MU radar. The principle of the measurement \\nand results are discussed.\\n\\n\\nEquatorial radar system\\nFUKAO, SHOICHIRO;  TSUDA, TOSHITAKA; SATO, TORU; KATO, SUSUMU\\n(Kyoto University, Uji, Japan)\\n(COSPAR, IAGA, SCOSTEP, et al., Plenary Meeting, 27th,\\nWorkshops and Symposium on the Earth's Middle Atmosphere,\\nEspoo, Finland, July 18-29, 1988) Advances in Space Research\\n(ISSN 0273-1177), vol. 10, no. 10, 1990, p. 151-154.\\n     A large clear air radar with the sensitivity of an incoherent \\nscatter radar for observing the whole equatorial atmosphere up to 1000 \\nkm altitude is now being designed in Japan. The radar will be built in \\nPontianak, West Kalimantan, Indonesia (0.03 deg N, 109.29 deg E). The \\nsystem is a 47-MHz monostatic Doppler radar with an active phased array \\nconfiguration similar to that of the MU radar in Japan, which has been \\nin successful operation since 1983. It will have a PA product of about \\n3 x 10 to the 9th W sq m (P = average transmitter power, A = effective \\nantenna aperture) with a sensitivity of approximately 10 times that of \\nthe MU radar. This system configuration enables pulse-to-pulse beam \\nsteering within 20 deg from the zenith. As is the case of the MU radar, \\na variety of operations will be made feasible under the supervision of \\nthe radar controller.

This\\n>also means that Christ had all of the legal rights of a decendant of\\n>David as according to at least Roman law (and possibly Mosaic law as\\n>well, but I am not sure) Joseph was Christ\\'s LEGAL FATHER.\\n\\nThe argument for Luke\\'s genealogy being that of Mary is very weak. According\\nto Luke 3:23\\n\\n   And when he began his ministry, Jesus himself was about \\n   thirty years of age, being supposedly the son of Joseph,\\n   the son of Eli,\\n\\nAside from the fact that Mary is not mentioned, there are two possible\\ninterpretations: either Joseph was her father or he was her brother.\\nClearly this is not acceptable.  A third would be that Joseph, the son\\nof Eli, was her Father and just happened to have the name as the man\\nto whom she was betrothed. But that would seem to be grasping at\\nstraws. The most straightforward interpretation is that Luke had no\\nintention of tracing Mary\\'s genealogy (in which case he would have\\nnamed her) but that he traces her husband\\'s, from David\\'s son Nathan.\\n\\nThe Matthew descendant list most definitely traces down from David\\'s\\nson, Solomon, to Joseph.  Matthew 1:16 reads:\\n\\n   And to Jacob was born Joseph, the husband of Mary, by whom was born\\n   Jesus, who is called Christ. \\n\\nThere are two apparent problems.  The first is, how to reconcile the\\ntwo paternal genealogies - which diverge with the sons of David,\\nSolomon and Nathan.  The second is, why is any genealogy of Joseph\\nrelavent at all, if Joseph had nothing to do with it.  If Joseph was\\nnot Jesus\\'s physical father, then the original poster is quite\\ncorrect, that claims for Jesus\\'s messianic heritage are not based on\\ntruth but only on appearances, whatever Jesus\\'s divine nature was.\\n\\nThe second problem is easy, in my mind.  We assume that Joseph was not\\ninvolved in the conception of Jesus in any way.  However, a Holy\\nSpirit capable of working a physical conception in Mary is also\\ncapable of employing the physical agency of Joseph\\'s seed in this\\nwork.  In our materialistic times we interpret viginity and its loss\\nsolely in terms of a physical act, whereas it is really a matter of\\npurity on a much higher level as well.  The important thing is that\\nneither Mary nor Joseph was conscious of any union between them (they\\nhad not \"known\"each other).  Thus the first gospel\\'s dedication of\\nhalf its opening chapter to the genealogy of Joseph is quite relevant\\nto Jesus, the Virgin birth not- withstanding.\\n\\nTo the first question there is an answer that creates, to begin with, more\\nproblems than it resolves.  It is that the two evangelists are relating \\nthe births of two entirely different children of two entirely different\\nsets of parents.  Except for the names of the parents and the child, and \\nthe birthplace in Bethlehem there is no point in common between the two \\nstories.  Matthew and Luke converge in their accounts only thirty years\\nlater with the Baptism of Jesus in Jordan.  Rudolf Steiner offered his\\nexplanation of how these accounts begin with two children and then converge\\nwith their accounts of the one Jesus of Nazareth.  He did not derive his\\nresolution from biblical study or speculation, or from other external\\ndocuments, and the discussion of \"how this could be\" might bring us beyond\\nthe limits of appropriateness for this newsgroup.  In any case, the\\ndetails are described in Steiner\\'s \"The Spiritual Guidance of the Human \\nBeing and of Humanity\", \"The Gospel of St. Luke\", and \"The Gospel of St.\\nMatthew\". \\n\\nWhether or not Rudolf Steiner\\'s methods and explanation are accepted\\nas valid, at least this interpretation resolves the apparent\\ncontradictions of the two genealogies while leaving the text intact.\\n\\nAs for the passing of one\\'s Jewishness through the mother, this was\\nnever an issue with Jesus. No one ever questioned his or Mary\\'s\\nJewishness.  The issue of the genealogies has to do with his paternal\\nline of descent from David, the king.\\n\\nGerry Palo (73237.2006@compuserve.com)\\n',\n",

They were neighbors.\\n\\nOK.\\n\\n[SY] Armenians killed Turks. Which Armenians? Their neoghbors? As far as my\\n[SY] grandparents are concerned, the Armenians attacked first but these \\n[SY] Armenians were not their neighbors. They came from other places. Maybe \\n[SY] first they had a training at some place. They were taught to kill people,\\n[SY] to hate Turks/Kurds? It seems so...\\n\\nThere is certainly a difference between the planned extermination of the\\nArmenians of eastern Turkey beginning in 1915, with that of the Armeno-\\nGeorgian conflicts of late 1918! The argument is not whether Armenians ever \\nkilled in their collective existence, but rather the wholesale destruction of\\nAnatolian Armenians under orders of the Turkish government. An Armenian-\\nGeorgian dispute over the disposition of Akhalkalak, Lori, and Pambak after\\nthe Turkish Third Army evacuated the region, cannot be equated with the\\nextermination of Anatolian Armenians. Many Armenians and Georgians died\\nin this area in the scramble to re-occupy these lands and the lack of\\npreparation for the winter months. This is not the same as the Turkish \\ngenocide of the Armenians nearly four years earlier, hundreds of kilometers\\naway!\\n\\n[SY] Anyway, but after they killed/raped/... Turks and other muslim people\\n[SY] around, people assumed that \\'Armenians killed us, raped our women\\',\\n[SY] not a particular group of people trained in some camps, maybe backed\\n[SY] by some powerful states... After that step, you cannot explain these \\n[SY] people not to hate all Armenians. \\n\\nI don\\'t follow, perhaps the next paragraph will shed some light.\\n\\n[SY] So what am I trying to point out? First, at least for that region,\\n[SY] you cannot blame Turks/Kurds etc since it was a self defense situation.\\n[SY] Most of the Armenians, I think, are not to blame either. But since some\\n[SY] people started that fire, it is not easy to undo it. There are facts.\\n[SY] People cannot trust eachother easily. It is very difficult to establish\\n[SY] a good relation based on mutual respect and trust between nations with\\n[SY] different ethnic/cultural/religious backgrounds but it is unfortunately\\n[SY] very easy to start a fire!\\n\\nAgain, the fighting between Armenians and Georgians in 1918/19 had little to\\ndo with the destruction of the Armenians in Turkey. It is interesting that\\nthe Georgian leaders of the Transcaucasian Federation (Armenia, Azerbaijan, \\nand Georgia) made special deals with Turkish generals not to pass through \\nTiflis on their way to Baku, in return for Georgians not helping the Armenians \\nmilitarily. Of course, as Turkish troops marched across what was left of\\nCaucasian Armenia, many Armenians went north and such population movement \\ncaused problems with the locals.

They\\nalso maintained that literature of a prophetic character could not be genuine\\nteachings from God.\\n\\tBy the time of c.65 CE, another faction had entered the mess.  Christians\\nhad come in claiming that THEIR writings were also suitable to be read in\\nsynagogues and used for worship.  Therefore, the Palestinian Jewish leaders\\ngot together and stated that the books written from the time of Ben Sira (Sirach)\\nonward were not sacred writings.  They justified this from Zech. 13.  In\\nparticular, they said, the writings of the Christians (called heretics) were\\nnot inspired.\\n\\tAt about 90 CE, they codified things further by closing the canon in\\nsomewhat of an official sense at the Council of Jamnia.  A few books (Ecclesi-\\nastes, Song of Songs, Esther) made it in after that date, but these were those\\nwhich had been written prior to the official cut off point (the time of Ben\\nSira) for inclusion that they had established in order to keep out the Christian\\nand Hellenistic writings.\\n\\tJerome excluded the \\'apocrypha\\' because they were not in use by Jews\\nof his day and because they were (except for Sirach) not found in Hebrew in his\\ntime.

Those scholars did indeed have an excellent\\nreason to assume that the suicide was successful.  As I pointed out, I\\nrecently checked several Lexicons:\\n\\n\\t\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\" Louw and Nida\\n\\t\"Robinson\\'s Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament\"\\n\\t\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\" Grimm\\n\\t\"Word study Concordance,\" Tynsdale\\n\\t\"A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other \\n\\t early Christian Writings,\" Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich\\n\\t\"The New Analytical Greek Lexicon,\" Perschbacher\\n\\nA couple simply stated \"hanged oneself\", and a couple were more explicit \\nand stated that \"apacgw\" means specifically \"kill yourself by hanging.\" A\\ncouple also noted that the meaning of one the root words for \"apacgw\" is\\n\"strangle, throttle or choke\" (which pretty much invalidates the guy who\\nsuggested to David Joslin that Judas was hung upside down).  One of the best\\nreferences though, \"Robinson\\'s Greek and English Lexicon of the New\\nTestament,\" not only stated the translation, it gave both the root words, the\\nliteral translation, related greek words which use the same roots, and also\\nother presented specific examples of the word in greek literature (to give\\nfurther context).  \\n\\nThe word \"apagchw\" has two root words: \"gchw\" is the \"to strangle\" root, and\\nthe root word \"apo\" means literally \"away.\" This root words is included in\\nwords which denote a transition.  It can mean a transition in place (eg: the\\ngreek word \"apagello\" means to send a message).  \"Apo\" can also denote a\\nchange in state and specifically the change from life to death.  Robinson\\nspecifically makes comparison to the word \"apokteiuo,\" which means \"to kill.\"\\nIn literal meaning the word \"apacgw\" means \"to throttle, strangle to put out\\nof the way,\" and implicitly denotes a change in life state (ie: away from\\nlife, to death).  So while the word \"apacgw\" does mean \"to hang,\" it\\nspecifically denotes a death as well.  Thus Robinson is quite specific when he\\nstate that it means \"to hang oneself, to end one\\'s life by hanging.\" He then\\nnotes the the use of \"apacgw\" in Homers Odessy 19:230 to denote context.  He\\npresents that example of \"apacgw\" as being used to explicitly mean \"suicide by\\nhanging.\" Now since there is a perfectly good word for strangling, without the\\nadded denotation of \"death,\" and as you insist that the Bible was written by\\nGod, and every word is precicely correct, you are stuck with the complete\\nmeaning of \"apacgw\" (ie: Since the word \"apacgw\" was used, then death is\\ndenoted as the result). \\n\\nBy the way, I note that Mr DeCenso also presents an example of \"apacgw\":\\n\\n> In the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the OT used at the time of Jesus),\\n> it\\'s only used in 2 Samuel 17:23 : \"Now when Ahithophel saw that his advice \\n> was not followed, he saddled a donkey, and arose and went home to his house,\\n> to his city. Then he put his household in order, and hanged himself, and \\n> died; and he was buried in his father\\'s tomb.\"   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n> ^^^^ \\n> Notice that not only is it stated that Ahithophel \"hanged himself\" [Gr. Sept.,\\n> APAGCHO], but it explicitly adds, \"and died\".  Here we have no doubt of the\\n> result.\\n> In Matthew, we are not explicitly told Judas died.\\n\\nNote Mr DeCenso, as you say, the Septuagint was a translation from Hebrew to\\nGreek, and you have not shown the original meaning of the Hebrew (ie\" the the\\nHebrew say \"and died\"), and thus whether it was simply echoed in the Greek. \\nIt should also be pointed out that, regardless of the added \"and died\", the\\ncorrect translation would still be \"apacgw,\" as the man did indeed die from\\nstrangulation (redundant, but correct).  Further, we have evidence that the\\nSeptuagint was repeatedly rewritten and reedited (which included versions\\nwhich contradicted each other), and such editing was not even necessarily\\nexecuted by Greeks.  Thus I am not sure that you can use the Septuagint as it\\nnow stands, as a paragon of ancient greek.  So, what you really need to prove\\nyour point Mr DeCenso, is an example, in ancient greek, of someone committing\\n\"apacgw\" and surviving.  Otherwise I would see you as simply making worthless\\nassertions without corresponding evidence. \\n\\nNow I would note Mr DeCenso, that everytime I go out of my way to research it\\none of your apparently contrived exegisis, I pretty much find it false.  Thus,\\nI think that if you are going to add to the text, something over and above\\nwhat the source clearly says, then you had better have an explicit Greek or\\nhistorical source to justify it. \\n\\nBy the way, as to Mr Rose\\'s statement about trees around the Potter\\'s Field:\\n\\n> There are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom.\\n\\nUnless Mr Rose can show that these trees are two thousand years old, or that\\nthere are 2000 year old stumps there, or has a 2 thousand year old description\\nof the area which mentions such trees, then it is inappropriate for him to\\nassert that the present placement of trees prove the location of the trees two\\nthousand years ago (after all, things change). \\n\\nNow as to your other argument, ie: that the money Judas used is not the same\\nas the 30 silvers:\\n\\n> As to your second question Mr DeCenso, you ask how we could be sure that the\\n> money with which Judas purchased the land, was indeed for the betrayal, rather\\n> than some other source.  I would point out that in Acts, where it specifically\\n> mention \"the reward of iniquity\" [Acts 1:18], it also specifically mentions\\n> what act of iniquity they were talking about (ie: Acts 1:16 \"...concerning\\n> Judas who was guide to those who arrested Jesus.\").  Now I would point out\\n> that when the Bible describes an act of \"iniquity,\" and then immediately\\n> discusses \"*the* reward of iniquity,\" it would be rather inane to suggest that\\n> it was an action of iniquity other than the one discussed.\"\\n> \\n>  \\n> Notice that in verse 16, the word \"iniquity\" is not used.  Rather, it states\\n> that Judas \"became a guide to those who arrested Jesus\".\\n> But the writer DID NOT stop there...vs. 17, \"for he was numbered with us and\\n> obtained a part in this ministry.\"  What part did Judas play in their ministry?\\n>          ^^^^^^\\n\\nTrue, Peter (or the author of Acts) does not specifically call Judas\\' betrayal\\n\"an iniquity,\" but for that matter, neither does John specifically call Judas\\'\\nactions \"an iniquity\" either.  Further John 13:29 did not say that Judas took\\nthe money box, but rather said:\\n\\n    \"Some thought that because, Judas had the money box, Jesus was telling\\n     him \"Buy what we need for the feast\"; or that he should give something\\n     to the poor, So after receiving the morsel he immediately went out, and\\n     it was night.\"\\n\\nNote that it is said that Judas left, it does not say that he took the money\\nbox.  Thus when I see your explanation it still seems to me you would choose\\nthe a an unproven iniquity, mentioned by another author, in a different\\nbook, written at a different time, over the iniquity explicitly mentioned by\\nthe author of acts.  I find this forced and contrived. \\n\\nOf course this particular argument becomes moot, since we have have seen\\nevidence that \"apacgw\" means suicide.  You see, since Judas\\' hanging was\\nsuccessful, he could not have spent the money mentioned in John 13:29, because\\nMatthew and Mark explicitly say the betrayal was on the high holy day (ie:\\nPassover), and thus he could not have spent the money before killing himself\\nthe next day.  Thus the money which bought the \"Field of Blood\" would have to\\nhave been the 30 pieces of silver (Of course he got the 30 pieces of silver\\nthat night as well, and thus couldn\\'t have spent that either.  Oh dear, I\\nbelieve that the house of cards is comming down). \\n\\nMaybe we should at this point, discuss now whether Jesus was crucified on\\nFriday or Saturday as that is now part of the argument about Judas.\\n\\nBy the way, as to where the prophesy of the Potter\\'s field came from (ie: the\\nmention of it in Matthew), you say:\\n\\n> Please, when we are done with this study on his death, remind me to discuss\\n> this with you.\\n\\nI am reminding you now to discuss it now. It\\'s all part of the same verse we\\nare discussing, and I wish you would quit procrastinating and sidestepping \\nthese issues.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLater,\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDave Butler\\n\\n\\tA wise man proportions his belief to the evidence.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDavid Hume, Philosopher\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAn Inquiry Concerning Human Understanding\\n\\n    PS. I would note again, that you are not stating that that Bible\\n    is not possibly inerrant; you are stating that it *IS* inerrant.\\n    Since you have been, by your own admission, presenting merely \"possible\"\\n    reconciliations (I of course don\\'t rate them that highly), then the \\n    best you can do is say that the Bible is \"possibly\" inerrant, not that \\n    it *is* inerrant.\\n',\n",

Features\\n===========\\n\\nDMPEG/DMPLAY is another MPEG decoder/player for the PC:\\n\\n\\n - decodes (nearly) the full MPEG video standard\\n   (I,P,B frames, frame size up to at least 352x240 supported)\\n\\n - saves decoded sequence in 8 or 24bit raw file for later display\\n\\n - optional on-screen display during decoding (requires VGA)\\n\\n - several dithering options: ordered dither, Floyd-Steinberg, grayscale\\n\\n - color-space selection\\n\\n - runs under DOS, 640KB RAM, no MS-Windows required\\n\\n - very compact (small code / small data models, 16 bit arithmetic)\\n\\n - real time display of the raw file by a separate player for\\n   VGA and many Super-VGAs\\n\\n...\\n\\n4. Technical information\\n========================\\n\\nThe player is a rather straightforward implementation of the MPEG spec [1].\\nThe IDCT is based on the Chen-Wang 13 multiplication algorithm [2]\\n(not quite the optimum, I know). Blocks with not more than eight non-zero\\ncoefficients use a non-separated direct multiply-accumulate 2D-IDCT\\n(sounds great, doesn't it?), which turned out to be faster than a 'fast'\\nalgorithm in this (quite common) case. Dithering is pretty standard. Main\\ndifference to the Berkeley decoder (except for the fewer number of supported\\nalgorithms) is the use of 256 instead of 128 colors, the (default) option to\\nuse a restricted color-space and the implementation of a color saturation\\ndominant ordered dither. This leads to a significantly superior quality of\\nthe dithered image (I claim, judge yourself).\\n\\nRestricted color-space means that the U and V components are clipped to\\n+/-0.25 (instead of +/-0.5) and the display color-space points are distributed\\nover this restricted space. Since the distance between color-space points\\nis thus reduced by a factor of two, the color resolution is doubled at the\\nexpense of not being able to represent fully saturated colors.\\n\\nSaturation dominant ordered dither is a method by which a color, lying\\nsomewhere between the points of the display color space, is approximated\\nby primarily alternating between two points of constant hue instead of\\nconstant saturation. This yields subjectivly better quality due to the\\nlower sensitivity of the human viewing system to saturation changes than\\nto hue changes (the same reasoning as used by the PAL TV standard to improve\\non NTSC). The improvement is particularly visible in dark brown or redish\\nareas.\\n\\n...\\n\\n--\\nStefan Eckart, stefan@lis.e-technik.tu-muenchen.de\\n\",\n",

Do not attempt to recollect your brass.The police will\\nuse it's location to piece together the scene along with your testimony and\\nthat of any witnesses. Mentally mark witnesses! If the police say that none\\ncame forward let them know who you saw! Attempt to keep your weapon loaded\\nwith the minimum required(how the hell can I phrase this?)

Second, the historical\\nrecord suggests that the positions attributed to Nestorius were not as\\nextreme as his (successful) opponents (who wrote the conventional history)\\nclaimed.  Mainly Nestorius opposed the term Theotokos for Mary, arguing\\n(I think correctly) that a human could not be called Mother of God.  I mean,\\nin the Athanasian Creed we talk about the Son \"uncreate\" -- surely even \\nArians would concede that Jesus existed long before Mary.  Anyway, Nestorius\\'s\\nopponents claimed that by saying Mary was not Theotokos, that he claimed\\nthat she only gave birth to the human nature of Jesus, which would require\\ntwo seperate and distinct natures.  The argument fails though, because\\nMary simply gave birth to Jesus, who preexisted her either divinely,\\nif you accept \"Nestorianism\" as commonly defined, or both natures intertwined,\\na la Chalcedon.\\n\\nSecond, I am not sure that \"Nestorianism\" is not a better alternative than\\nthe orthodox view.  After all, I find it hard to believe that pre-Incarnation\\nthat Jesus\\'s human nature was in heaven; likewise post-Ascension.  I think\\nrather that God came to earth and took our nature upon him.  It was a seperate\\nnature, capable of being tempted as in Gethsemane (since I believe the divine\\nnature could never be tempted) but in its moments of weakness the divine nature\\nprevailed.\\n\\nComments on the above warmly appreciated.\\n\\nJason Albert\\n\\n[There may be differences in what we mean by \"subject to sin\".  The\\noriginal complaint was from someone who didn\\'t see how we could call\\nJesus fully human, because he didn\\'t sin.  I completely agree that\\nJesus was subject to temptation.  I simply object to the idea that by\\nnot succumbing, he is thereby not fully human.  I believe that you do\\nnot have to sin in order to be human.\\n\\nI again apologize for confusing Nestorianism and monophysitism.  I\\nagree with you, and have said elsewhere, that there\\'s reason to think\\nthat not everyone who is associated with heretical positions was in\\nfact heretical.  There are scholars who maintain that Nestorius was\\nnot Nestorian.  I have to confess that the first time I read some of\\nthe correspondence between Nestorius and his opponents, I thought he\\ngot the better of them.\\n\\nHowever, most scholars do believe that the work that eventually led to\\nChalcedon was an advance, and that Nestorius was at the very least\\n\"rash and dogmatic\" (as the editor of \"The Christological Controversy\"\\nrefers to him) in rejecting all approaches other than his own.  As\\nregular Usenet readers know, narrowness can be just as much an\\nimpediment as being wrong.  Furthermore, he did say some things that I\\nthink are problematical.  He responds to a rather mild letter from\\nCyril with a flame worthy of Usenet.  In it he says \"To attribute also\\nto [the Logos], in the name of [the incarnation] the characteristics\\nof the flesh that has been conjoined with him ... is, my brother,\\neither the work of a mind which truly errs in the fashion of the\\nGreeks or that of a mind diseased with the insane heresy of Arius and\\nApollinaris and the others.  Those who are thus carried away with the\\nidea of this association are bound, because of it, to make the divine\\nLogos have a part in being fed with milk and participate to some\\ndegree in growh and stand in need of angelic assistance because of his\\nfearfulness ...  These things are taken falsely when they are put off\\non the deity and they become the occasion of just condemnation for us\\nwho perpetrate the falsehood.\"\\n\\nIt\\'s all well and good to maintain a proper distinction between\\nhumanity and divinity.  But the whole concept of incarnation is based\\non exactly the idea that the divine Logos does in fact have \"to some\\ndegree\" a part in being born, growing up, and dying.  Of course it\\nmust be understood that there\\'s a certain indirectness in the Logos\\'\\nparticipation in these things.  But there must be some sort of\\nidentification between the divine and human, or we don\\'t have an\\nincarnation at all.  Nestorius seemed to think in black and white\\nterms, and missed the sorts of nuances one needs to deal with this\\narea.\\n\\nYou say \"I find it hard to believe that pre-Incarnation that Jesus\\'s\\nhuman nature was in heaven.\"  I don\\'t think that\\'s required by\\northodox doctrine.  It\\'s the divine Logos that is eternal.\\n\\n--clh]\\n',\n",

If ONLY black geese are observed to be axed, is it not a valid question \\n>   to be concerned with the different behavior between black and white geese?\\n\\nMore red herrings.  Could Jim mean that he has read an uncountably large\\nnumber of my articles?  Could Jim mean that because I \"axed\" his articles,\\nbut not Weiss\\' articles, he wants to conclude inductively ...\\nWell, I can\\'t see where he is going with this.\\n\\nBut I can help him with his induction.  I\\'ve written roughly 80\\narticles since January.  The vast majority of them are discussions with\\nFrank DeCenso and other inerrantists, where I take the position that\\nthey are making bad arguments.  Some are discussions with Jim Meritt\\nwhere I take the position that he is making bad arguments (a straw man\\nargument earlier, and taking quotes out of context more recently.)\\n\\nThink hard about this Jim.  See the pattern?  Think harder.  Run it\\nthrough your induction engine and see what pops out.  \\n\\ndj\\n',\n",

Specifically, are there an\\ninfinite number of Heavens, and a person goes to the one that\\nhe/she deserves?  Or is it simply Heaven or nothing (Hell?)\\nAlso, are we \"graded\" by those around us, or has there always\\nbeen some unchanging method?  Is the person\\'s childhood taken\\ninto account?\\n\\tI\\'m sure these must sound like over-simplifications to\\nmost of you, but I figure that you\\'re the experts.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t-Quinn\\n\\n[Eschatology is an area on which Christians do not agree.  I suspect\\nthat\\'s because our primary source of information is prophets and\\nvisionaries, and their writings tend to be highly symbolic.  However\\nboth Jesus\\' teachings in the Gospels and books such as the Revelation\\nto John talk primarily about the difference between eternal life and\\neternal death.  On a number of occasions Jesus does say things that\\nimply some sort of differentiation, e.g. Lk 10:14 and a number of\\nsimilar passages where Jesus says things like \"even XXX will be better\\noff than you in the judgement.\"  Also, I Cor 3 talks about someone who\\ngets into heaven, but by the skin of his teeth, as it were.  But these\\npassages are not normally interpreted as suggesting separate heavens,\\nso much as differing levels of prestige or punishment in heaven or\\nhell (and not all Christians would even go as far as that).  The only\\nChristian group I know of that believes in multiple heavens is the\\nMormons, and they are very far from mainstream Christianity (far\\nenough that many of our readers would not call them Christian).  Their\\nideas in this area involve specific Mormon revelations, in addition\\nto the Bible and \"Holy Tradition\" of a more generic Christian sort.\\n\\nNote that many Christians will cringe at the very thought of\\nassociating grading with God.  The whole point of Christ was to free\\nus from the results of a test that we couldn\\'t possibly pass.  If you\\nlike test analogies, God grades on a very strict and unbending scale,\\nbut he also cheats -- he replaces our test papers with an exam that\\nwas prepared by the teacher, before actually doing the grading.\\nBecause some people end up in heaven and others in hell, it\\'s easy to\\nsee why you\\'d be inclined to think of it as grading.  While there are\\ndifferences among branches of Christianity on details, I think we all\\nagree that in one way or another, God cheats.\\n\\nI am personally very sceptical about anyone who claims to know exactly\\nhow far God\\'s cheating extends.  Will he accept people who don\\'t\\nexplicitly acknowledge Christ, but somehow still follow him in their\\nhearts?  Many Christians believe that this is possible, at least in\\nprinciple, but certainly not all do.  Jesus provided us with a clear\\ndescription of how to be saved, but it\\'s not clear to me that he\\nprovided an exact description of how he\\'s going to place the dividing\\nline.  Certainly he made it clear that we can\\'t expect to know whether\\nother individuals are saved or not.\\n\\n--clh]\\n',\n",

These viewers are available for all types of computers at \\nmost large FTP sites around Internet.  JPG viewers are a bit\\ntougher to find.  If you can\\'t find one, but do have a GIF viewer,  \\nyou can obtain a JPG-to-GIF conversion program which will change    \\nJPG files to a standard GIF format. \\n\\nOTIS also accepts animation files.      \\n\\nWhen you submit image files, please send me email at the same time\\nstating information about what you uploaded and whether it is to be\\nused (in publications or other projects) or if it is merely for people\\nto view.  Also, include some biographical information on yourself, we\\'ll\\nbe having info-files on each contributing artist and their works.  You \\ncan also just upload a text-file of info about yourself (instead of \\nemailing).\\n\\nIf you have pictures, but no scanner, there is hope.  Merely send\\ncopies to:\\n\\nThe OTIS Project\\nc/o Ed Stastny\\nPO BX 241113\\nOmaha, NE 68124-1113\\n\\nI will either scan them myself or get them to someone who will  \\nscan them.  Include an ample SASE if you want your stuff back.  \\nAlso include information on each image, preferably a 1-3 line \\ndescription of the image that we can include in the infofile in the\\ndirectory where it\\'s finally put.  If you have preferences as to what\\nthe images are to be named, include those as well.  \\n \\nConversely, if you have a scanner and would like to help out, please\\ncontact me and we\\'ll arrange things.\\n\\nIf you want to submit your works by disk, peachy.  Merely send a 3.5\"\\ndisk to the above address (Omaha) and a SASE if you want your disk back.\\nThis is good for people who don\\'t have direct access to encoders or FTP,\\nbut do have access to a scanner.  We accept disks in either Mac or IBM\\ncompatible format.  If possible, please submit image files as GIF or\\nJPG.  If you can\\'t...we can convert from most formats...we\\'d just rather\\nnot have to.\\n\\nAt senders request, we can also fill disks with as much OTIS as they\\ncan stand.  Even if you don\\'t have stuff to contribute, you can send\\na blank disk and an SASE (or $2.50 for disk, postage and packing) to \\nget a slab-o-OTIS.\\n\\nAs of 04/21/93, we\\'re at about 18 megabytes of files, and growing.  \\nEmail me for current archive size and directory.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDISTRIBUTION?\\n\\nThe images distributed by the OTIS project may be distributed freely   \\non the condition that the original filename is kept and that it is\\nnot altered in any way (save to convert from one image format to\\nanother).  In fact, we encourage files to be distributed to local \\nbulletin boards and such.  If you could, please transport the\\nappropriate text files along with the images.  \\n \\nIt would also be nice if you\\'d send me a note when you did post images\\nfrom OTIS to your local bbs.  I just want to keep track of them so\\nparticipants can have some idea how widespread their stuff is.\\n\\nIt\\'s the purpose of OTIS to get these images spread out as much as\\npossible.  If you have the time, please upload a few to your favorite\\nBBS system....or even just post this \"info-file\" there.  It would be\\nkeen of you.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nUSE?\\n\\nIf you want to use any of the works you find on the OTIS directory,\\nyou\\'ll have to check to see if permission has been granted and the \\nstipulations of the permission (such as free copy of publication, or\\nfull address credit).  You will either find this in the \".rm\" file for    \\nthe image or series of images...or in the \"Artists\" directory under the \\nArtists name.  If permission isn\\'t explicitly given, then you\\'ll have \\nto contact the artist to ask for it.  If no info is available, email\\nme (ed@cwis.unomaha.edu), and I\\'ll get in contact with the artist for \\nyou, or give you their contact information.\\n \\nWhen you DO use permitted work, it\\'s always courteous to let the artist\\nknow about it, perhaps even send them a free copy or some such\\ncompensation for their files.\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNAMING IMAGES?\\n\\nPlease keep the names of your files in \"dos\" format.  That means, keep\\nthe filename (before .jpg or .gif) to eight characters or less.  The way\\nI usually do it is to use the initials of the artist, plus a three or\\nfour digit \"code\" for the series of images, plus the series number.\\nThus, Leonardo DeVinci\\'s fifth mechanical drawing would be something\\nlike:\\n \\n\\tldmek5.gif     OR    ldmek5.jpg    OR    ldmech5.gif   ETC\\n\\nKeeping the names under 8 characters assures that the filename will\\nremain intact on all systems.  \\n\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------- \\n\\nCREATING IMAGE FILES?\\n\\nWhen creating image files, be sure to at least include your name\\nsomewhere on or below the picture.  This gives people a reference in\\ncase they\\'d like to contact you.  You may also want to include a title,\\naddress or other information you\\'d like people to know.\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nHMMM?!\\n\\nThat\\'s about it for now.  More \"guidelines\" will be added as needed.\\nYour input is expected.\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDISCLAIMER:  The OTIS Project has no connection to the Church of OTIS  \\n \\t     (a sumerian deity) or it\\'s followers, be they pope, priest,\\n\\t     or ezine administrator.

OTIS\\n\\t     takes no responsibility for this.  In simple terms, all rights\\n\\t     revert to the author/artist.  To leave an image on OTIS is to \\n\\t     give permission for it to be viewed, copied and distributed \\n\\t     electronically.  If you don\\'t want your images distributed     \\n\\t     all-over, don\\'t upload them.  To leave an image on OTIS is\\n\\t     NOT giving permission to have it used in any publication or\\n\\t     broadcast that incurs profit (this includes, but is not \\n\\t     limited to, magazines, newsletters, clip-art software,        \\n\\t     screen-printed clothing, etc).

However,\\n\\nThis is quite a misrepresentation.  After WWI, many Bosnian Muslims were\\nkilled and their land taken over by Serbs, and the motive was plunder,\\nnot some fictitious \"supression of rebellion.\"  Even earlier, one can\\npoint to the destruction of mosques in Serbia itself and expulsion of\\nMuslims.  Here is what Dr. Vaso Cubrilovic, political adviser to the\\nSerbian monarchic regime, says in his memorandum \"The Expulsion of the\\nArnauts\" which he presented to the royal government of Stojadinovic\\non March 7, 1937, in Belgrade:\\n\\n   The Mode of Removal\\n   -------------------\\n\\n   [ describes how expulsion of ethnic Albanians from Kosova is to proceed\\n   through state terror and \"private initiative\", i.e. Chetnik plunder: ]\\n\\n   Private initiative, too, can assist greatly in this direction.  We should\\n   distribute weapons to our colonists, as need be.  The old forms of Chetnik\\n   action should be organized and secretly assisted.  [...]\\n   ...the whole affair should be presented as a conflict between clans and,\\n   if need be, ascribed to economic reasons.  Finally, local riots can be\\n   incited.  These will be bloodily suppressed with the clans and the\\n   Chetniks, rather than the army.\\n\\n   There remains one more means, WHICH SERBIA EMPLOYED WITH GREAT PRACTICAL\\n   EFFECT AFTER 1878, that is, by secretly burning down Albanian villages\\n   and city quarters.\\n\\n(Emphasis above is mine.)  These events in Serbia itself forced out virtually\\nall Muslims during late 19th century.  This policy of state terrorism\\nagainst Muslims, aided by Chetnik \"private initiative,\" has continued in WWII\\nand today.  For example, Muhamed Hadzijahic in his book \"Od tradicije do \\nidentiteta: Geneza nacionalnog pitanja bosanskih Muslimana\" (Sarajevo:\\nSvjetlost, 1974) writes (pg. 235) how Serbs killed a Muslim in Foca\\nin WWII even though he claimed to be a Serbian patriot, explaining\\ntheir action as follows:\\n\\n   \"Inasmuch as you were a Serb, you sullied the Serb name, because you\\n   are a Turk [i.e. Muslim].  And since you helped us, we shall not\\n   torture you.\"\\n\\nso the shot him instead of cutting his throat.  In the past year, Serbs\\nhave repeated the slaughter of Muslim residents of Foca.  Destruction\\nof mosques, including priceless historical monuments, completes the\\neradication of the Muslim presence from territories claimed by Serbs.\\n\\n\\n>>I strongly dispute your notion that Croats had a similar older agenda,\\n>>in fact, for the past century or two, Croats and Muslims have seen\\n>>themselves as having a lot in common, and they generally had friendly\\n>>relations.

The last major battles between\\nAustro-Hungarian monarchy and the Ottoman Empire in Croatia were at the\\nend of the 17th century.  Need I remind you that modern Croatian nationalism\\ncame into being with Dr. Ante Starcevic, who saw Bosnian Muslims as the\\nbest Croats, so much so that in 1853 he contemplated moving his operations \\nto Sarajevo?  You are confusing clericalist Croatianism with Croatian\\nnationalism here.   Political nationalism has always been stronger.  As\\nfor your other theories, you are clearly overjoyed that Croat-Muslim\\nalliance in Bosnia-Herzegovina is now in trouble.  Arguments such as\\nyours are clearly intended to create and deepen this split.  \\n\\n>\\tI should add few more things.  A.J.

Balance of power thinking has brought together Croats\\nand Bosnian Muslims.  This is only natural; all other alignments are\\nunstable.  I\\'m working on pointing out this basic fact: Croats and\\nMuslims have been aware of it for as long as Serbia has existed.  \\nYou are wrong if you think only \"image\" is at stake here.  Croatia has\\na deep interest in her alliance with Bosnian Muslims, and vice versa.  \\n\\nI think Tudjman understands this, although he does not have much choice \\nat this point.  Tensions should have been defused better earlier, before \\nany open confrontation developed.  Although I still think Croatia will\\nsurvive, it will lose a lot; but Bosnian Muslims may end up even worse\\noff.  However, their position now is so horrible that perhaps they do not\\nsee it getting any worse.  The key point is: do they still have any hope left?\\nIf not, then all bets are off.\\n\\nMr. Stojanovic is clearly very, very happy about this.

Finally speaking of \\nspending money, with the size of today\\'s files, etc, a tape backup is \\ncertainly worth $200-$300.  Recently I set up a friend\\'s PC 50Mhz and VESA \\nlocal bus.  The redraw time for a graphics program was only a factor of 2 \\nfaster which I doubt warrants the extra cost.\\n',\n",

ABout\\na year ago I found that the master cylinder on the clutch in the '84 was        \\nleaking fluid around the piston seal, leading to air in the system and fluid\\nback into the passenger compartment of the car.  I pulled the plunger and\\ngot a rebuild kit (new plunger, seal, etc.) and thought I had the problem\\nlicked.  Much to my surprise, the same problem developed several months\\nlater!  This time I looked carefully at the master cylinder to make sure\\nthere were no scratches, burrs, or other obvious causes of the problem.  I\\ndidn't find any.  Ever since I have been periodically feeding the clutch\\nhydraulins additional fluid and bleeding air from the system.  I knew I\\nwould be selling the car and didn't want to go all the way to solving the\\nproblem.\\n\\nI should add that the clutch is original, and that I've had to adjust the\\npedal to allow maximum extension of the piston into the master cylinder in\\norder to actuate the clutch.\\n\\nMy hypothesis is that this means that when fully depressing the clutch pedal,\\nthe angle of the piston rod (attached to the pedal) is off the axix of the\\ncylinder, thus cocking the piston and seal and perhaps deforming it.\\n\\nWhat do you think of that as an explanation?  Can you suggest a possible fix\\nshort of replacing the master cylinder and getting a new clutch put in?\\n\\nNow the '86: same problem, except that the above diagnosis doesn't explain\\nwhy all of the fluid leaked out (by way of the master cylinder, into the\\npassenger compartment) while I was on vacation for 10 days, during which\\nthe clutch pedal was not depressed or otherwise caused to distort.

Metzger) writes:\\n> You obviously haven\\'t read the information about the system. The chips\\n> put out serial number infomation into the cypher stream to allow\\n> themselves to be identified.

The system may\\nnot rely upon registering people as owning particular phone units, but\\nit is necessary to know which phone units are likely to be used for some\\nsuspected criminal communication before you can obtain their unit keys\\nfrom escrow.  This necessity raises the stakes in favor of a criminal\\'s\\ncoercing or colluding use of some other person\\'s Clipper phone.\\n\\nI will restate my assumptions more explicitly and amplify my argument.\\nThe original title perhaps should have been \"Distinction between legal\\nand illegal cipher systems considered harmful\", but \"Clipper considered\\nharmful\" is not inaccurate, and is more eye-catching in the current context.\\n\\nAssumptions:\\n\\n  1.  Clipper is made available.\\n\\n  2.  Laws are passed to make use of cipher systems other than Clipper illegal\\n      (either on radio systems, or on any common carrier system).  These laws\\n      also include enforcement authority to listen across the relevant radio\\n      spectrum (or other medium), characterize signals, validate Clipper\\n      wrappers, detect probable use of non-Clipper ciphers, and make such\\n      detection a cause for further action.\\n\\n  3.  For escrowed keys to be useful, some specific Clipper chip must be\\n      associated with a suspected criminal.  This means that at a minimum\\n      some association between the common carrier\\'s unique phone ID (ESN) and\\n      the Clipper chip serial number N will be stored in a government database.\\n      An observed pairing of N and ESN other than the one recorded raises a\\n      red flag.\\n\\n  4.  To reduce ordinary fraud, the cellphone system which offers Clipper\\n      will also be constructed with an ESN mechanism much more tamper-proof\\n      and much less spoofable than today\\'s cellphones.\\n\\n  5.  Criminals want inscrutable communications.  Some criminals are not\\n      entirely stupid or ignorant, and will figure out both that Clipper\\n      cellphones offer excellent security in normal circumstances, and that\\n      they offer no security against law enforcement once a (presumably\\n      legitimate) wiretap order exists.  They will also figure out that the\\n      wiretap order must necessarily be against a specific cellphone, because\\n      each one has a unique unit key.\\n\\n  6.  Criminals do not want to call attention to themselves.  Because they\\n      are not stupid or ignorant (or because they read netnews), and because\\n      they know that their open use of a non-Clipper cipher is likely to be\\n      detected, they will generally avoid using non-Clipper ciphers directly\\n      on some monitorable/tappable channel.  They know that do so would raise\\n      a red flag, putting a given cellphone (if not a given person) under\\n      immediate suspicion.\\n\\n  7.  It is impractical to reverse engineer Skipjack, discover family key F,\\n      and construct a functional clone of a Clipper chip.\\n\\nBy #2, #3, #4, and #7 it will be very difficult to spoof a given Clipper\\nphone without immediate detection.  Because it is difficult to obscure one\\'s\\nassociation to a specific phone by reprogramming or changing chips\\naround, the criminal will be motivated to find an intact phone which is\\nassociated with someone else.\\n\\nA non-stupid criminal will conclude that they can have Clipper-secure\\ncommunications, at least for some limited time T, if they buy, beg, borrow,\\nor steal use of someone\\'s phone in a way that prevents that person from\\nreporting compromise of the phone for at least time T.  The encrypted\\ncommunications might have been recorded, and thus be retrievable later,\\nbut the criminal can delay, and quite likely evade, discovery by destroying\\nor abandoning the phone before T elapses.\\n\\nIt would be unusual for an innocent person to volunteer use of their Clipper\\nphone to someone else.  The honest subscriber doesn\\'t want to pay someone\\nelse\\'s bill, and he doesn\\'t want to fall under suspicion.\\n\\nThis leaves two sources of Clipper phones for criminal use: coercion\\nand collusion.\\n\\nCoercion first.  Theft bears a relatively low risk, but also sometimes\\na low time until detection (a few minutes if a phone is stolen from\\na car parked in front of a store, a couple of weeks if a phone is stolen\\nfrom someone who is away on vacation).  Criminal commerce is likely to\\narise in stolen Clipper phones, with phones coming from risk-inured poor\\ncriminals, and cash coming from risk-averse wealthy criminals.  Someone\\nwho is extraordinarily motivated to gain a day or two of undetected\\ncommunication (like a terrorist) could kill a person or hold them hostage.\\nThe limited time (before detection) that a coerced phone is useful means\\nthat continuing criminal enterprises require a continuing supply of\\nfreshly coerced phones.\\n\\nThere would also be created a collusive commerce between relatively\\nwealthy criminals, and ignorant or don\\'t-care patsies who need money,\\nand who will submit to being paid in return for subscribing to Clipper\\nphone service for someone else\\'s use.\\n\\nCriminals will learn that it is more to their advantage to coerce use of a\\nClipper cellphone than it is to apply a non-Clipper cipher to a normal\\ncellphone.  They will call much less attention to themselves (or at least to\\ntheir stolen phone) this way.  The fact of a phone\\'s use being coerced must\\nfirst be reported before it can be identified as an interesting phone, and\\nhave its keys obtained from escrow.\\n\\nClipper also allows an extraordinary opportunity for the criminal to\\nconceal use of super-encryption.  An automated full-system surveillance\\nmechanism (quite feasible across radio bandwidth) which knows family key F,\\ncan validate Clipper wrappers and N:ESN associations, but it cannot reveal\\nin realtime the use of super-encryption, unless it knows all unit keys,\\nwhich we are being assured are only to be made available in two separate\\npieces, upon specific wiretap-like order.\\n\\nWhereas a criminal\\'s use of any cipher within a normally cleartext medium\\nwould stand out, a criminal\\'s use of a non-Clipper cipher within a Clipper\\nmedium would be very difficult to detect, even ex post facto in bulk\\nrecordings, as long as the association between criminal and specific Clipper\\nchip is fractured.\\n\\nIf you make use of this other cipher illegal per se, then you can charge\\nthe criminal with this (if you can identify the true criminal - he\\'ll be\\nusing someone else\\'s phone), but you\\'ll have no evidence to help you against\\nwhatever traditional crime he might have been planning.  You will not even be\\nable to detect that unusual (encrypted) communications are occurring until you\\nidentify specific phones and obtain their keys from escrow.\\n\\nThe gangster and terrorist are thus arguably more, not less, secure than\\nthey were before Clipper came along.\\n\\nI therefore consider Clipper harmful because:\\n\\n  1.  It does not provide absolute privacy to the honest public against\\n      aggressive or dishonest government.\\n\\n  2.  If other ciphers are proscribed, it engenders new types of direct\\n      criminal threat to the honest public.\\n\\n  3.  It provides an extraordinarily effective mechanism for criminals to\\n      hide their use of some other cipher, making it more difficult than\\n      ever even to gain notice that unusual communications are occurring\\n      and that plans for some criminal act might be in progress.\\n\\n  4.  If other ciphers are proscribed, lazy investigators and prosecutors\\n      are more likely to pursue the easily quantifiable cipher-use crime\\n      than they are the traditional and directly harmful crimes which key\\n      escrow is claimed to help against.\\n\\n  5.  If other ciphers are proscribed, the stage is set for witch hunting\\n      of \"illegal\" cipher use.  Because any computer can be used as a cipher\\n      machine...\\n\\nBrad Yearwood    brad@optilink.com     {uunet, pyramid}!optilink!brad\\nPetaluma, CA\\n',\n",

Now\\nwhat, pray tell, do you think will happen when the area of the brain\\nnecessary for the normal rhythm of gonadotropin release is missing?\\nAre you trying to say that humans have no need of their pituitary,\\nANH, and ME, of that part of the brain that is responsible for\\ncontrolling the realease (albeit indirectly) of estradiol and testosterone? \\n\\nHow do you expect anyone to do the studies on this? It\\'s unethical to\\n\"sacrifice\" humans to check out what effects chronic, acute, etc doses\\nof these compounds are having on the brain tissue in humans.  The food\\nindustry knows this.

Certainly\\nthe doses for excitotoxicity in adults are considerably larger than\\nfor the young, but the additivity of Glu and Asp, and their copious\\nand increased presence in modern processed foods (jointly), and their\\nhidden presence in HVP, necessitates extreme caution. Why would anyone\\nwant to eat compounds which have been shown to markedly perturb the\\nendocrine system in adults?

Apparently, the refugees had been shot down as \\nthey ran. An Azerbaijani film of the places we flew over, shown to \\njournalists afterwards, showed DOZENS OF CORPSES lying in various parts \\nof the hills.\\n\\nThe Azerbaijanis claim that AS MANY AS 1000 have died in a MASS KILLING \\nof AZERBAIJANIS fleeing from the town of Khodjaly, seized by Armenians \\nlast week. A further 4,000 are believed to be wounded, frozen to death \\nor missing... \\n\\nSeven of us squatted in the cabin of an Azerbaijani M24 attack helicopter \\nas we flew to investigate the claims of the mass killings. Suddenly there \\nwas a thump against the underside of the aircraft, a red flash of tracer \\nripped past the starboard wing, and the helicopter rocked sharply. We \\nswung round, and there was a deafening burst of fire from the cannon \\nunder our wing as the helicopter crew returned fire.\\n\\nWe had been fired on from an Armenian anti-aircraft post. We swung round \\nagain, tipped to starboard and appeared to dive straight down into a \\nvalley. The brown earth swooped around our heads, the helicopter swung \\nround again and followed the contours of the ground. Our cannon fired \\nrepeated blasts.\\n\\nLater it emerged that a civilian helicopter that we had been escorting \\nhad landed successfully at Nakhichevanik in the east of the disputed \\nenclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, to pick up some of the dead. We had, in \\nfact, been attacked both by ground fire and by an Armenian helicopter. \\nI had seen the Armenian helicopter intermittently through the window, \\nits cannons firing, but had thought - mistakenly - that it was on \\n\"our side\". Our group of Western journalists had embarked on a \\nsearch-and-rescue flight that had become a combat mission.\\n\\nOur flight consisted of the civilian passenger helicopter and two \\nM24 Soviet attack helicopters in the Azerbaijani service, nicknamed \\nflying crocodiles for their armour. Our party was in the second \\ncrocodile. The civilian helicopter\\'s job was to land in the mountains \\nand pick up bodies at sites of the mass killings. The attack helicopters \\nwere there to give covering fire if necessary.\\n\\nThe operation showed a striking sign of the disintegration of the Soviet \\narmed forces because our pilot was a Russian officer. An Azerbaijani \\nofficial told us that there were now five former Soviet military \\nhelicopters -and their pilots- fighting for Azerbaijan. \"They have \\nsigned contracts to fly for us,\" he said. The helicopter we engaged \\nin combat was most probably flown by a brother-officer of our Russian \\npilot, but fighting for the Armenians.\\n\\nWe had taken off just before 5pm on Saturday from Agdam airfield, an \\nheated for the Armenian-controlled mountains of Karabakh, a sheer \\nwhite wall in the distance. The civilian helicopter picked up four \\ncorpses, and it was during this and a previous mission that an \\nAzerbaijani cameraman filmed the several the several dozen bodies \\non the hillsides. We then took off again in a hurry and speed back \\ntowards Azerbaijani lines. Azerbaijani gunners on the last hill before \\nthe plain - and safety - gazed up at us as we passed.\\n\\nBack at the airfield in Agdam, we took a look the bodies the \\ncivilian helicopter had picked up.

Remember: you do *not*\\nwant the run-of-the-mill Mac-to-VGA adapter, because it will try to\\nhave your IIsi produce the VGA mode, which it cannot (the computer\\nwill just fail to produce any video signal at all).  Instead, you want\\nan adapter that connects between the Mac-style and VGA-style\\nconnectors, but tells the Mac to use the Apple 640x480 mode.  Sorry\\nfor the poor terminology available for describing this distinction.\\n\\nAs far as (b) is concerned, make sure to get a monitor that can deal\\nwith a horizontal bandwidth of 35 KHz and a vertical retrace rate of\\n67 Hz.  These are the spec\\'s of Apple\\'s 640x480 mode.  For comparison,\\nthe VGA-standard 640x480 mode uses a 31.5 KHz horizontal bandwidth and\\na 60 Hz. vertical retrace rate.\\n\\nThe monitor will probably need to have auto-synch\\'ing capability, as\\nthe Apple mode you\\'ll be using isn\\'t one of the set of standard modes\\nin the PC compatible world.\\n\\nGood luck!\\n\\n\\t-Fred Martin\\n\\n\\n-- \\nFred Martin | fredm@media.mit.edu | (617) 253-7143 | 20 Ames St. Rm.

Opening\\nstatements were given by both the prosecution and the defense,\\neach side presenting its version of what happenned last August.\\n\\nThe prosecution argued that Weaver and his family moved to\\nIdaho in 1983 anticipating a battle with the \"evil\" federal\\ngovernment.  The prosecution alleges that Weaver sold federal\\nagents \"sawed off\" shotguns and later failed to appear for\\ntrial: Despite repeated \"good faith\" efforts to get Weaver\\nto surrender peacefully, Weaver refused.  The shootout erupted\\nwhen Weaver discovered agents on a surveillance mission and\\nbegan firing.  According to the prosecution, three people\\nwere taking an \"offensive action\" against an FBI helicopter\\nwhen an FBI sniper killed Vicki Weaver.\\n\\nThe defense argued that Weaver and his family moved to northern\\nIdaho in 1983 to practice their religion in peace.  They wanted\\nsimply to be left alone.  Weaver was induced by federal agents to\\nsell the short-barrelled shotgun (and did not, as the prosecution\\nalleged, want to become a \"regular supplier\").  The defense also\\nargued that the federal government sought to arrest Weaver when\\nhe wouldn\\'t become an informant [it is not specified explicitly,\\nbut I assume that this is a reference to the white separatist\\nangle of the story.  We\\'ll know more as things develop].  The\\nfailure to appear in court happenned because Weaver was given\\nan incorrect court date and then indicted before that date.\\nThe shootout occurred when federal agent Arthur Roderick killed\\nWeaver\\'s dog that was in proximity to Weaver\\'s son, Samuel.  Weaver\\nthen fired in self-defense.  In the ensuing battle, federal\\nagent William Degan was killed (when his gun was later found,\\nthere were 7 .223 cases nearby and the gun was on semi-automatic:\\nHowever, agents were near the body for an extended period of\\ntime and could have played with the select-fire - this will\\nhave to be more fully explained).  Finally, the defense claims\\nthat Vicki Weaver was only going to \"look at the body\" [not recover?]\\nof her son when she was cut-down by an FBI sniper.\\n\\nProsecution quote: \"Weaver wanted that confrontation, and he made\\nthat confrontation.\" -- Asst. U.S. Attorney Kim Lindquist\\n\\nDefense quote: \"The evidence in this case is going to show that\\nthis is a case where Randy Weaver and Kevin Harris are charged\\nwith crimes they didn\\'t commit in order to cover crimes that\\nthe government did commit.\"  -- Gerry Spence  [nice soundbite!]\\n\\nNotes: The _Idaho Statesman_ claims that Weaver supporters\\nheeded a call from Spence not to repeat yesterday\\'s protests\\noutside the courthouse.  However, the local NBC affiliate\\nagain had footage on the 10:00 news with 5 supporters including\\n\"Tim\" again.  \"Tim\" claimed he was a skinhead, who were \"ordinary,\\nworking class people.\"  He also claimed he was for \"white pride,\\nnot white power.\"\\n\\nOutside the courthouse the television crew had an impromptu interview\\nwith Bo Gritz, who charged that the neo-nazi protestors are exactly\\nwhat the government wants to smear Randy Weaver.\\n\\nIn an affiliated article carried in the _Idaho Statesman_, about\\na dozen lawyers were among the 70 or so people packed into the\\ncourthouse.  These lawyers were present to watch Gerry Spence\\nin action, and to perhaps learn something from him.  Some\\ntidbits: Spence flatly told the jurors that he and his son Kent\\nwere volunteering their time to represent Weaver because they\\nbelieved in him.  Spence, during his 90-minute opening statement,\\nrepeatedly walked behind Weaver and placed his hands on the\\ndefendants shoulders (Weaver broke down and cried during the\\nrecounting of his wife\\'s death), and Spence compared the \"sawed\\noff\" shotgun to driving 56 mph when the limit was 55 (another\\ngood one!).\\n\\nToday (Thursday, April 15th) the prosecution was scheduled to\\nbegin presenting evidence.\\n\\nDrew\\n=============================================================\\n\\n\\n-- \\n**************************************************************\\n* Ron Phillips               crphilli@hound.dazixca.ingr.com *\\n* Senior Customer Engineer                                   *\\n* Intergraph Electronics                                     *\\n* 381 East Evelyn Avenue               VOICE: (415) 691-6473 *\\n* Mountain View, CA 94041              FAX:   (415) 691-0350 *\\n**************************************************************\\n',\n",

This just really blew my socks off.  Read I Tim\\n1: 3-11.  Verses 3-8 speaks against those who have perverted the teachings of\\nthe Mosaic Law.  In vv.9-10, we have, *IN ORDER*, the 5th thru the 9th\\ncommandments and in the midst of this listing is \"homosexuals.\"  The decalogue,\\nabove everything else, is seen as God\\'s absolute.  If you don\\'t believe in\\nabsolutes, then you have nothing do do with Jehovah of the OT, which Paul\\nreveals to be the Messiah of the NT. \"Lord Christ Jesus\" transliterates to read\\n\"Jehovah\\'s Anointed Savior.\"  \\n  In I Cor5, we see the same emphasis of moral separation from the pagan\\ngentiles as we do in Lev 18-20.  In I Cor 6:9-10, only one notation (drunkards)\\nis not found in Lev 18-20.  Paul was not naive in his use of the LXX.  He knew\\nfull well how he was using the Law of God that was given in the OT, for\\napplication in the NT.  As I\\'ve said, the Law was fulfilled, not done away\\nwith.\\n\\n>>of questions we are trying to deal with.

He had never faced the experience of Christians who try to act\\n>>\"straight\" and fail, and he had never faced Christians who are trying\\n>>to define a Christian homosexuality, which fits with general Christian\\n>>ideals of fidelity and of seeing sexuality as a mirror of the\\n>>relationship between God and man.  It is unfair to take Paul\\'s\\n>>judgement on homosexuality among idolaters and use it to make\\n>>judgements on these questions.\\n\\nThis understanding is thoroughly rebutted in DeYoungs article that is being\\nposted.  Please refer to it.\\n\\n>\\n>One of the reasons that some of us do not accept that common argument\\n>is because Paul probably did face this and other problems. \\n\\nWe can do better than \"probably\" which is not an adequate defense against the\\nstatement that Paul\\'s culture didn\\'t have the same understanding of\\nhomosexuality as ours.  \\nAgain read the article because it uses facts.\\n\\n>>I claim that the question of how to counsel homosexual Christians is\\n>>not entirely a theological issue, but also a pastoral one.\\n>\\n>I don\\'t see how you come to that conclusion.\\n\\nI think I do, because I have worked in the homosexual community by means of\\nworking with AIDs patients.  The pastoral is merely the practical application\\nof the theological truth however.  Those who are working thru the issue of\\nhomosexuality need to have our love and understanding just as with a friend who\\nis contiplating cheating on his wife or a friend who lives with his girlfriend,\\nyet you continue to witness to him.  But, once the choice is made, and there is\\nno remorse, then I feel that Paul\\'s \"pastoral\" care, as presented in the\\nCorinthian Church, come to bear significance.  THe one in active rebellion\\nshould be placed outside of the church if a believer, and if a non-believer,\\nthen one wipes his sandels and leaves it in Gods hand.  If there was a member\\nin your youth group who was constantly pawing at the little girls, you wouldn\\'t\\nhesitate to deal with the matter quickly and decisivly.  That, in part, betrays\\nthe present \"political correctness\" of the issue.  Pederasty is not accepted at\\nthe present, but some how we are to accept homosexuality because the latter is\\npolitically correct, while the former is not -at least not yet.  THis is how\\nthe morals decay.  \\n\\nI guess this would follow the liberal application in the political realm of\\neconomics.  The liberals want to tax the rich in the federal, yet in their own\\nstates, when they try to get businesses to settle there, they give tax\\nincentives to these same richies.  It comes down to a moral code of\\nrelativeness, or to use the cultural thing, politically correct -at the moment.\\n--Rex\\n\\n[You might want to look over 1 Tim 1:10 again.  If this is really the\\n5th through 9th commandments, we seem to be missing thieves, and\\nhomosexuals would have to be fit in under adultery.  This is of course\\npossible if \"arsenokoitia\" has a narrower meaning than homosexuality\\nin general, but I think that\\'s not your thesis.  I have no objection\\nper se to the idea that the author of 1 Tim might have quoted the 10\\ncommandments, but 5 through 9, minus one and plus a few things, begins\\nto look a bit marginal.  --clh]\\n',\n",

These finer particles are considered hazardous because \\nthey are small enough penetrate into the lung.  Cities are considered out of \\ncompliance with clean air laws if the 24-hour average concentration of PM10 \\nexceeds 150 micrograms per cubic millimeter of air.  \\n     In Seattle however, a link between fine particles and asthma was found at \\nlevels as low as 30 micrograms.  The authors concluded that for every 30 \\nmicrogram increase in the four-day average of PM10, the odds of someone with \\nasthma needing emergency treatment increased by 12 percent.  \\n     The findings were published in the April American Review of Respiratory \\nDisease, an official journal of the American Thoracic Society, the Lung \\nAssociation\\'s medical section.  \\n     The study is the latest in a series of recent reports to suggest that \\nparticulate matter is a greatly under appreciated health threat.  A 1992 study \\nby Dr. Schwartz and Douglas Dockery, Ph.D., of Harvard found that particles \\nmay be causing roughly 60,000 premature deaths each year in the United States.  \\nOther studies have linked particulate matter to increased respiratory symptoms \\nand bronchitis in children.  \\n     \"Government officials and the media are still very focused on ozone,\" \\nsays Dr. Schwartz.  \"But more and more research is showing that particles are \\nbad actors as well.\"      One problem in setting, standards for particulate \\nair pollution is that PMIO is difficult to study.  Unlike other regulated \\npollutants such as ozone and carbon monoxide, particulate matter is a complex \\nand varying mixture of substances, including carbon, hydrocarbons, dust, and \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 29\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nacid aerosols.  \\n     \"Researchers can\\'t Put people in exposure chambers to study the effects \\nof particulate air pollution,\" says Dr. Schwartz.  \"We have no way of \\nduplicating the typical urban mix of particles.  \" Consequently, most of what \\nis known about particulates has been learned through population-based research \\nlike the Seattle study.  \\n     Given that the EPA\\'s current priority is to review the ozone and sulfur \\ndioxide standards, the agency is unlikely to reexamine the PM10 standard any \\ntime soon.  Until changes are made, there appears to be little people with \\nasthma can do to protect themselves from airborne particles.\\n     \"In some areas, you can get reports on air quality, but the reports only \\ncover the pollutant that is closest to violating its standard, and that\\'s \\nrarely particulate matter,\" says Dr.  Schwartz.  \"However, PM10 doesn\\'t have \\nto be near its violation range to be unhealthy.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 30\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\n               NIH Consensus Development Conference on Melanoma\\n\\nThe National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference on \\nDiagnosis and Treatment of Early Melanoma brought together experts in \\ndermatology, pathology, epidemiology, public education, surveillance \\ntechniques, and potential new technologies as well as other health care \\nprofessionals and the public to address (1) the clinical and histological \\ncharacteristics of early melanoma; (2) the appropriate diagnosis, management, \\nand followup of patients with early melanoma; (3) the role of dysplastic nevi \\nand their significance; and (4) the role of education and screening in \\npreventing melanoma morbidity and mortality.

Within the program, there are four types \\nof cancer centers:  basic science cancer centers (14), which engage primarily \\nin basic cancer research; clinical cancer centers (12), which focus on \\nclinical research; \"comprehensive\" cancer centers (28), which emphasize a \\nmultidisciplinary approach to cancer research, patient care, and community \\noutreach; and consortium cancer centers (1), which specialize in cancer \\nprevention and control research. \\n \\nAlthough some cancer centers existed in the late 1960s and the 1970s, it was \\nthe National Cancer Act of 1971 that authorized the establishment of 15 new \\ncancer centers, as well as continuing support for existing ones.  The passage \\nof the act also dramatically transformed the centers\\' structure and broadened \\nthe scope of their mission to include all aspects of basic, clinical, and \\ncancer control research.  Over the next two decades, the centers\\' program grew \\nprogressively. \\n \\nIn 1990, there were 19 comprehensive cancer centers in the nation. Today, \\nthere are 28 of these institutions, all of which meet specific NCI criteria \\nfor comprehensive status. \\n \\nTo attain recognition from the NCI as a comprehensive cancer center, an \\ninstitution must pass rigorous peer review.  Under guidelines newly \\nestablished in 1990, the eight criteria for \"comprehensiveness\" include the \\nrequirement that a center have a strong core of basic laboratory research in \\nseveral scientific fields, such as biology and molecular genetics, a strong \\nprogram of clinical research, and an ability to transfer research findings \\ninto clinical practice. \\n \\nMoreover, five of the criteria for comprehensive status go significantly \\nbeyond that required for attaining a Cancer Center Support Grant (also \\nreferred to as a P30 or core grant), the mechanism of choice for supporting \\nthe infrastructure of a cancer center\\'s operations.  These criteria encompass \\nstrong participation in NCI-designated high-priority clinical trials, \\nsignificant levels of cancer prevention and control research, and important \\noutreach and educational activities--all of which are funded by a variety of \\nsources. \\n \\nThe other types of cancer centers also have special characteristics and \\ncapabilities for organizing new programs of research that can exploit \\nimportant new findings or address timely research questions. \\n \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 32\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nOf the 55 NCI-designated Cancer Centers, 14 are of the basic science type.  \\nThese centers engage almost entirely in basic research, although some centers \\nengage in collaborative research with outside clinical research investigators \\nand in cooperative projects with industry to generate medical applications \\nfrom new discoveries in the laboratory. \\n \\nClinical cancer centers, in contrast, focus on both basic research and \\nclinical research within the same institutional framework, and frequently \\nincorporate nearby affiliated clinical research institutions into their \\noverall research programs.  There are 12 such centers today. \\n \\nFinally, consortium cancer centers, of which there is one, are uniquely \\nstructured and concentrate on clinical research and cancer prevention and \\ncontrol research.  These centers interface with state and local public health \\ndepartments for the purpose of achieving the transfer of effective prevention \\nand control techniques from their research findings to those institutions \\nresponsible for implementing population-wide public health programs.  \\nConsortium centers also are heavily engaged in collaborations with \\ninstitutions that conduct clinical trial research and coordinate community \\nhospitals within a network of cooperating institutions in clinical trials. \\n \\nTogether, the 55 NCI-Designated Cancer Centers continue to work toward \\ncreating new and innovative approaches to cancer research, and through \\ninterdisciplinary efforts, to effectively move this research from the \\nlaboratory into clinical trials and into clinical practice. \\n \\nComprehensive Cancer Centers (Internet addresses are given where available) \\n \\nUniversity of Alabama at Birmingham Comprehensive Cancer Center\\nBasic Health Sciences Building, Room 108\\n1918 University Boulevard\\nBirmingham, Alabama 35294\\n(205) 934-6612\\n \\nUniversity of Arizona Cancer Center\\n1501 North Campbell Avenue\\nTucson, Arizona 85724\\n(602) 626-6372\\nInternet:  syd@azcc.arizona.edu\\n \\nJonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center\\nUniversity of California at Los Angeles\\n200 Medical Plaza\\nLos Angeles, California 90027\\n(213) 206-0278\\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 33\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nInternet:  rick@jccc.medsch.ucla.edu\\n \\nKenneth T.

The \\ndecision ends the controversy between Army AIDS researchers who had hoped to \\ntest a vaccine made by  MicroGeneSys Inc. and the National Institutes of \\nHealth, which  contended that multiple vaccines should be tested.  Health and  \\nHuman Services Secretary Donna Shalala said a final announcement  on the \\ntherapeutic vaccine trials was expected to be made last  Friday.  Companies \\nincluding Genentech Inc., Chiron Corp., and  Immuno AG have already told NIH \\nthat they are prepared to  participate in the vaccine tests.  The testing is \\nintended to  demonstrate whether AIDS vaccines are effective in thwarting the  \\nreplication of HIV in patients already infected.  Shalala refuted last week\\'s \\nreports that the Clinton administration had decided  the Army\\'s test of the \\nMicroGeneSys VaxSyn should proceed without tests of others at the same time.  \\n\"The report was inaccurate,  and I expect there to be some announcement in the \\nnext 24 hours  about that particular AIDS research project,\" said Shalala.   \\nAdministration sources subsequently confirmed that NIH director  Dr. Bernadine \\nHealy and Food and Drug Administration Commissioner David Kessler had \\nconvinced the White House that multiple  vaccines should be tested \\nsimultaneously.  But MicroGeneSys  president Frank Volvovitz said a test of \\nmultiple vaccines could  triple the cost of the trial and delay it by two \\nyears.\\n\\n==================================================================    \\n\\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 41\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\n\"The Limits of AZT\\'s Impact on HIV\" U.S. News & World Report (04/12/93) Vol. \\n114, No. 14, P. 18 \\n\\n     AZT has become the most widely used drug to fight AIDS since it  was \\napproved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1987.   Burroughs Wellcome, \\nthe manufacturer of AZT, made $338 million  last year alone from sales of the \\ndrug.  However, a team of  European researchers recently reported that \\nalthough HIV-positive patients taking AZT demonstrated a slightly lower risk \\nof  developing AIDS within the first year of treatment, that benefit  \\ndisappeared two years later.  The Lancet published preliminary  findings of \\nthe three-year study, which could give more reason  for critics to argue the \\ndrug\\'s cost, side effects, and general  efficacy.  Even though U.S. \\nresearchers concede the study was  more comprehensive than American trials, \\nmany argue the European  researchers\\' suggestion that HIV-positive patients \\nexperience  little improvement in their illness before the development of  \\nAIDS symptoms.

To give you a real-world example, here at Quarterdeck we have\\nroughly 100 people using DVX to talk to a bunch of unix boxes, novell\\nfile servers, and each other. It's not _too_ much of a load on our\\nEthernet (with maybe 4 concentrators, so you have 20-30 people on each\\nsegment). If you had a badly loaded net, or the apps you wanted to run\\nwere very network intensive, you could run into some slowdowns.\\n\\nBut the biggest problem would be the machine itself. Say you have a 486\\n33 with plenty of ram and a fast hard disk and network card. If you have\\n10 people running programs off it, you're going to see some slowdowns\\nbecause you're now on (effectively) a 3.3 MHz 486. Of course, DVX will\\nattempt to see if tasks are idle and make sure they give up their time\\nslice, but if you have 10 working programs running, you'll know it.\\n\\nHaving said that, if you can tweak the programs being run (by adding\\nin calls to give up time slices when idle and that sort of\\nthing), you could probably run 15-20 people on a given machine before\\nyou started seeing slowdowns again (this time from network bandwidth).\\nIt all really depends on what the programs are doing (ie. you're going\\nto see a slowdown from X-bandwidth a lot sooner if your apps are all\\ndoing network things also...)\\n-- \\n       Quarterdeck Office Systems - Internet Support - Tom Bortels\\n Pricing/Ordering : info@qdeck.com  |  Tech Questions : support@qdeck.com\\n  BBS: (310) 314-3227 * FAX: (310) 314-3217 * Compuserve: GO QUARTERDECK\\n   Q/Fax: (310) 314-3214 from touch-tone phone for Technotes On Demand!\\n\",\n",

Hmm.\\nI\\'d read that sleazy salesmen sometimes bug their own offices so they\\ncan leave and listen in on couples discussing the sales offer, and\\nI mentioned this aloud to my friend while we were sitting there wondering\\nwhy they would leave us in the office instead of showing us to the\\ndoor.  For lack of anything better to do, I picked up the phone on\\nthe desk and called another Mazda dealership, asked for a salesman,\\nand began discussing what kind of price they would consider.  A few\\nsentences into the conversation, Mr. Salesmanager broke into the line\\n(!) and began telling me how rude he thought it was that I would call\\nanother dealership from \"his\" phone!  I said that since he\\'d announced\\nthat our business was over, he shouldn\\'t care, and every time I tried\\nto talk to the other sales guy the sales manager would drown out our\\nvoices with his own.  (How did he know that I was using the phone,\\nanyway?)  Finally, I hung up and we headed out of the showroom.\\nSales manager and cronies come out of a little unmarked room and he\\nbegins to berate us again.

Where Luke (1:17) reports\\nthe angel Gabriel prophesying that John will go before Christ \"in the \\npower and spirit of Elias\", In Matthew 11: 14, Jesus himself says of John,\\n   \\n   \"And if you care to accept it, he himself is Elijah, who\\n    was to come\".\\n\\nIt is interesting that Jesus prepended the words, \"If you care to accept\\nit\", as if to say that the implications of this truth, namely of rein-\\ncarnation, I will not force on you, but for those who can accept it, here it\\nis.  A Jewish poster to other newsgroups on Jewish esotericism and other\\ntopics has outlined the esoteric, cabbalistic Jewish teaching of of\\nreincarnation and Karma, a teaching that is little known among Jews\\ntoday, but which is apparently widespread enough in Israel that Hannah\\nHurnard (\"Hinds Feet on High Places\") was told about it by a Rabbi\\nshe was trying to convert back in the 1940s as a missionary in Palestine.\\nThus there may well have been a small number of Jews who knew about this,\\nwhereas the large number of people did not.  The statement of Jesus about \\nJohn, the greatest human personality in the New Testament, is guarded\\nbut nevertheless quite direct.  Again, the subject of reincarnation, one\\nway or another, is not a subject of the New Testament, nor is the fate in general\\nof the human being between death and the last judgement.  But there are \\noccasional indications that point to it.\\n\\nAs for the \"popular belief\" that Elijah would come again, it was more than \\na popular belief, as Jesus confirms it in more than one place, and he never \\ncorrected those who were expecting Elijah --  for example, those who thought \\nthat Jesus himself be he.\\n\\nGerry Palo (73237.2006@compuserve.com)\\n',\n",

The media has proven itself very accurate\\nis the areas of presenting raw, undisputed data.  One good\\nexample would be the weather page in which high and low\\ntemperatures of the previous day for a large number of\\nlocations are posting.  There is little evidence to show\\nthat they are in error.\\n\\nThe American media has failed us in its analysis of complex\\nevents, however.  I\\'m sure that we can come up with many\\nnews stories that have left us angry because so many facts\\nhave been ommitted.  Cases that come to mind are the\\ninvasion of Panama, the war with Iraq, the disaster in Waco,\\nthe issues surrounding the acceptance of gays into the\\nmilitary, the war on drugs, and many others.\\n\\nThe story that you bring to light was regarding the new\\nsex survey.  While I\\'m sure that due to lazyness some of\\nthe data was ommitted from the article, I would venture to\\nguess that the data that was presented did not deviate\\nfrom the survey.  I do, however, think that it would be\\nfolly to have blind faith in a single newswriter\\'s\\nanalysis of this data.  In this particular case, there was\\nlittle analysis, and the reader was left to draw his/her\\nown convictions.\\n\\nMany netters, Mr. Cramer included, often forget that the\\nAmerican media are merely a number of businesses, who\\'s\\npurpose in life is to make money for their owners and\\nstockholders.  Revenues come largely from advertisers\\nwho merely want maximum useful exposure per dollar.  The\\nmedia is like fast food; the quality of the food (or of\\nthe reporting) will improve only if the customers demand\\nas such.  Otherwise, it is business as usual.\\n-- \\nMark Walsh (walsh@optilink) -- UUCP: uunet!optilink!walsh\\nAmateur Radio: KM6XU@WX3K -- AOL: BigCookie@aol.com -- USCF: L10861\\n\"What, me worry?\" - William M.

And enlightening.\\n\\nHere\\'s my analysis of Jose Canseco, circa Sep \\'92, and Jose Canseco,\\ncirca June 1986.\\n\\n1.  He\\'s bulked up too much.  Period.  He needs to LOSE about 20 pounds,\\n    not gain more bulk.\\n\\n2.  His bat speed has absolutely VANISHED.  Conservatively, I\\'d say he\\'s\\n    lost 4%-7% of his bat speed, and that\\'s a HUGE amount of speed.\\n\\n3.  That open stance is KILLING him.   Note that he acts sort of like\\n    Brian Downing - way open to start, then closes up as ball is\\n    released.  Downing could do this without significant head movement -\\n    Canseco can\\'t.  Also, note that Canseco doesn\\'t always close his\\n    stance the same way - sometimes, his hips are open, sometimes,\\n    they\\'re fully closed.  Without a good starting point, it\\'s hard\\n    to make adjustments in your swing.\\n\\nWhat would I do, if I were Jose?\\n\\nAside from salting away a large sum of a cash that I could never touch,\\nso that I\\'d never have to work again, I\\'d restructure my entire swing.\\n\\nFirst, minimize movement before the swing.  Close and widen the stance,\\nand severely cut down the stride I take on my swing.  Hopefully, this\\nwill cut down on the time I need to swing, and will allow me to move\\nthe bathead more freely.\\n\\nSecond, drop 20 pounds.  Cut out the weight work.\\n\\nThird, relax the wrists.  Will cost some power, but until I can find\\nmy 1988 stroke, concentrate on keeping the back shoulder up, rolling\\nthe wrists through the strike zone, and hit line drives.  His strength\\n is more than enough so that some of those line drives will get out of\\nthe park.\\n\\nIf Canseco\\'s open stance and resulting bad habits are a result of his back\\nproblems, he\\'ll be out of baseball in three years.  If not, he could\\nstill hit 600+ HR.\\n\\n\\n-- \\n*   Gary Huckabay   * \"You think that\\'s loud enough, a$$hole?\"           *\\n*   \"Movie Rights   * \"Well, if you\\'re having trouble hearing it, sir,   *\\n*   available thru  *  I\\'d be happy to turn it up for you.

Note\\nthat I am *not* (yet) saying that it has anything to do with the\\nquestion at hand.\\n\\nSuppose we have a simplified Lotto game.  You pick a number from 1-10\\nand win if that number is drawn.  Suppose we have a large population\\nof people who play this game every week.\\n\\nIn the first year of the game, approximately 1/4 of the population\\nwill win 7 or more times.\\n\\nIn the second year of the game, 1/4 of those 7-time winners will again\\nbe 7-time winners.\\n\\nIn the third year of the game, 1/4 of those who won 7 or more times in\\neach of the first two years will win 7 again.\\n\\nSuppose I started with 1024 people in my population.  After three\\nyears, I have 32 people who have consistently, in each of the last\\nthree years, won 140% or more the number of times expected.\\n\\nDo we expect them to be big winners in the fourth year of the game?\\nNo.  Because we know there is no skill involved.  Nothing about these\\n\"consistent winners\" can influence their chances of winning.  But\\nsuppose we *don\\'t* know whether or not there is a chance that skill\\nmight be involved.  Perhaps some of the people in our population are\\npsychic, or something.  How would we test this hypothesis?\\n\\nWe can look for correlations in the population.  Now most of the\\npopulation will show zero correlation.  But our psychics should show a\\nhigh positive correlation (even if they aren\\'t very good psychics,\\nthey should still manage to win 7 or more times most years).  Net\\nresult?  A small positive correlation over the entire population.\\n\\n>This probably brings us to the heart of the disagreement I am having\\n>with others on this topic.  Must any conclusion based on statistical\\n>history be able to be applied broadly throughout a data base before\\n>it has any validity?  Is it impossible (or irrational) to apply\\n>statistical analysis to selected components of the data base?\\n\\nWell, zero correlation is zero correlation.  You mention that Sabo has\\nhit poorly in the clutch over the last 3(?) years.  But if we look at\\nthe past, we find that clutch patterns are just as likely to reverse\\nas they are to remain consistent.  The length of the streak doesn\\'t\\nseem to make a difference to the probability that the player will be\\nclutch or choke the next year.  Is there any reason to expect *this*\\nstreak to be different from past streaks?\\n\\nNow if it were true that \"75% of all three-year streaks remained true\\nto form\", then we might have something useful.  But then we wouldn\\'t\\nhave zero correlation.  Instead we have \"50% of all three-year streaks\\nremain true to form, and 50% of all three-year streaks reverse\".  You\\nlook at those numbers and say \"three year choke streak implies more\\nlikely to choke this year\".  But it would be equally valid to look at\\nthose numbers and say \"three year choke streak implies more likely to\\nbe clutch this year\", since the probabilities are split 50-50 each\\nway.\\n\\n>I completely accept that reasoning.  Again, what if we were to find\\n>the same individuals at each end of the spectrum on a consistent\\n>basis? \\n\\nThen we would have something useful.  And we would also have a\\npositive correlation.  But for every individual that exhibits such a\\npattern and holds true, there is another who exhibits such a pattern\\nand then reverses.\\n\\nCheers,\\n-Valentine\\n',\n",

A\\nsociety of  individuals  and  organizations  that  would  expend  the\\ntime and resources to use a  series  of  \\'digital  pseudonyms\\' to\\navoid data linkage does not in my opinion make big brother\\nobsolete but  acts  on  the  assumption  that  big  brother  is  ever\\npresent.  I  view  your  system  as  a  form  of  societal  paranoia.\\n\\n\\tAs a matter of  principle,  we  are  working  to  enact  formal\\nlegal protections for  individual  privacy  rather  than  relying  on\\ntechnical solutions.   We want to  assume  a  society  of  law  which\\nrespects legal limits rather than  a  society  that  will  disobey  the\\nlaw, requiring  citizens  to  depend  on  technical  solutions.  e.g.\\nrequire  a  judical  warrant  for  government  interception  of  data\\ncommunications rather than  encrypt  all  messages  on  the  assumption\\nthat regardless of the lawt  the  government  will  abuse  its  power\\nand invade privacy.\\n\\n\\tAs a  matter  of  practicality,  I  do  not  think  your  system\\noffers much hope for privacy.    First, the trend toward universal\\nidentifiers  is  as  much.-a  movement  generated  by  government  or\\nindustry\\'s desire to keep track of all citizens as it is by\\ncitizens seeking simplicity and convenience in all transactions.\\nAt best,  your  system  would  benefit  the  sophisticated  and  most\\nwould opt for  simplicity.  The  poor  and  the  undereducated  would\\nnever use or benefit from it.\\n\\n\\tFinally where there\\'s a  will, there\\'s  a  way. If  government\\nwants to link data bases, it  will,  by  law, require  the  disclosure\\nof various individual pseudonyms used by citizens or prohibit it\\nfor data bases which the government wants to link.      Since\\ncorporations  make  money  by  trading  commercial  lists  with   one\\nanother, they will never adopt  the  system  or  if  it  is  adopted,\\nwill use \"fine printn  contracts  to  permit  selling  various   codes\\nused by their customers to other firms.\\n\\n\\tThe solution remains law, policy, and consensus about limits\\non government or corporate intrusion into areas of individual\\nautonomy.  Technique can be used to enforce that consensus or to\\noverride it. It cannot be used as a substitute for such\\nconsensus.\\n\\n\\n\\n                                            Sincerely Yours,\\n\\n                                             /Sig/\\n\\n                                            Jerry J.

For \\n1-30 days, you\\'re covered for 80% of the public hospital rate, 100%\\nafterward.  With extra private insurance, you can get into a private\\nhospital and be covered for any differences beyond the public hospital\\nrate.  The public insurance covers 100% beyond 30 days, or the same\\ncash amount for a private hospital and the difference is paid\\nout-of-pocket or according to your supplementary private insurance.\\nOver 2/3rds of French have some form of extra private insurance.  So,\\nthe other 30% of health costs in Europe are out of private funds, not\\ngleaned from other taxes.  The GDP figures are combined public and\\nprivate expenditures for total outlay using the same methods that\\nyield the 13-14% figure for the U.S.\\n\\n>ISN\\'T THE PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INDUSTRY JUST TOO BIG  \\n>AND POWERFUL TO KILL?  \\n>\\n>Dismantling the health segment of our insurance industry would be  \\n>\"politically thorny,\" in the quiet words of one advocate for a  \\n>national plan.

You can opt out in Canada\\nand Germany, but you\\'ll have to go uninsured as a result because\\nthere are too few other people that do so --- i.e., no market.\\n\\nWhen private insurance realized how much money they\\'d make without the\\nrisks involved in basic insurance (e.g., neurosurgery) versus deluxe\\namenities (e.g., having to call Granada TV to replace a rental set on\\nthe fritz in someone\\'s private hospital room), they started to pat\\nthemselves on the back for their social responsibility.

Sophisticated\\nencryption can have this effect in the United States.  When\\nexported abroad, it can be used to thwart foreign intelligence\\nactivities critical to our national interests.  In the past, it has\\nbeen possible to preserve a government capability to conduct\\nelectronic surveillance in furtherance of legitimate law\\nenforcement and national security interests, while at the same time\\nprotecting the privacy and civil liberties of all citizens.  As\\nencryption technology improves, doing so will require new,\\ninnovative approaches.\\n\\nIn the area of communications encryption, the U. S. Government has\\ndeveloped a microcircuit that not only provides privacy through\\nencryption that is substantially more robust than the current\\ngovernment standard, but also permits escrowing of the keys needed\\nto unlock the encryption.  The system for the escrowing of keys\\nwill allow the government to gain access to encrypted information\\nonly with appropriate legal authorization.\\n\\nTo assist law enforcement and other government agencies to collect\\nand decrypt, under legal authority, electronically transmitted\\ninformation, I hereby direct the following action to be taken:\\n\\nINSTALLATION OF GOVERNMENT-DEVELOPED MICROCIRCUITS\\n\\nThe Attorney General of the United States, or her representative,\\nshall request manufacturers of communications hardware which\\nincorporates encryption to install the U.S. government-developed\\nkey-escrow microcircuits in their products.  The fact of law\\nenforcement access to the escrowed keys will not be concealed from\\nthe American public.  All appropriate steps shall be taken to\\nensure that any existing or future versions of the key-escrow\\nmicrocircuit are made widely available to U.S. communications\\nhardware manufacturers, consistent with the need to ensure the\\nsecurity of the key-escrow system.  In making this decision, I do\\nnot intend to prevent the private sector from developing, or the\\ngovernment from approving, other microcircuits or algorithms that\\nare equally effective in assuring both privacy and a secure key-\\nescrow system.\\n\\nKEY-ESCROW\\n\\nThe Attorney General shall make all arrangements with appropriate\\nentities to hold the keys for the key-escrow microcircuits\\ninstalled in communications equipment.  In each case, the key\\nholder must agree to strict security procedures to prevent\\nunauthorized release of the keys.  The keys shall be released only\\nto government agencies that have established their authority to\\nacquire the content of those communications that have been\\nencrypted by devices containing the microcircuits.  The Attorney\\nGeneral shall review for legal sufficiency the procedures by which\\nan agency establishes its authority to acquire the content of such\\ncommunications.\\n\\nPROCUREMENT AND USE OF ENCRYPTION DEVICES\\n\\nThe Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with other appropriate\\nU.S. agencies, shall initiate a process to write standards to\\nfacilitate the procurement and use of encryption devices fitted\\nwith key-escrow microcircuits in federal communications systems\\nthat process sensitive but unclassified information.  I expect this\\nprocess to proceed on a schedule that will permit promulgation of\\na final standard within six months of this directive. \\n\\nThe Attorney General will procure and utilize encryption devices to\\nthe extent needed to preserve the government\\'s ability to conduct\\nlawful electronic surveillance and to fulfill the need for secure\\nlaw enforcement communications.  Further, the Attorney General\\nshall utilize funds from the Department of Justice Asset Forfeiture\\nSuper Surplus Fund to effect this purchase.\\n',\n",

I've\\nrefrained from posting, in hope that someone who is more familiar with\\nthe OT than I would answer.  But at this point I feel I have to say\\nsomething.\\n\\nMany things about this posting bother me.  I know of not the slightest\\nsuggestion in the NT that Christians should use force to propagate the\\nGospel, and the idea that we should not be concerned about the death\\nof Moslems violates the heart of the Gospel.  Christ died to break\\ndown these distinctions.  In him there is neither Jew nor Greek, there\\nis neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female.  If\\nMoslems do not know him, we may preach to them, but we don't kill\\nthem.  Furthermore, the attack is between states, not religions.\\nThere are Christians being attacked as well.  One of the towns under\\nattack is one of the few places where Christians and Moslems are\\nliving together peacefully.\\n\\nThe precedents being suggested are from the OT.  There are in fact two\\ndifferent things being alluded to.  The first is from the entry into\\nCanaan.  For that to be a parallel, we would need for God to have\\npromised this land through a prophet.  And we would need the war to be\\na holy war.  There were tight constraints on behavior in those\\nattacks.  Any violations were likely to cause the Israelites to be\\ndefeated.  Rape would not have been tolerated.  While the accounts in\\nJoshua emphasize towns that were totally destroyed, note that it was\\npossible for a town to make peace with the Israelites, and that once\\nthat was done -- even when deception was involved -- they were\\nexpected to honor it.  In contrast, there have been many violations of\\nagreement in this incident. I see no evidence that God has granted\\nBosnia to the Serbs as a promised land, and if he had, their behavior\\nwould have disqualified this from being a holy war.\\n\\nThe other OT parallel is from later, when Israel was defeated by\\nAssyria and Babylonia.  The prophets saw this as a judgement on Israel\\nfor her sins.  Someone asks whether we shouldn't see this as a\\njudgement on the Bosnians for their sins.  This sounds like a replay\\nof the old claim that we shouldn't have doctors or hospitals because\\nillness is God's judgement.  Yes, even bad things may be used by God\\nfor good.  That includes actions of bad people.  But that doesn't\\njustify them.  If you read the prophets, you find them very clear that\\nin attacking Israel, the Assyrians and Babylonians were acting as\\n*unintentional* agents of God.  Their intent was to attack God's\\npeople, and they would be judged for it.  The fact that they were\\nactually carrying out God's plan didn't excuse their action.\\nFurthermore, we shouldn't conclude from this that all attacks are\\njudgements from God.  God explicitly interpreted that case, through\\nhis prophets.  As far as I know, he did not send any prophets to\\nBosnia.  While I find it hard to see any good in the current fighting,\\nI am sure God will eventually make good come out of bad.  But that\\ndoesn't justify it, and it won't save the people who are doing it from\\njudgement.\\n\\nI am particularly concerned about the implications of this issue\\nbecause of current tensions between the West and Moslem-oriented\\nnations.  What we do not need is for Moslems to conclude that\\nChristians think it's OK to kill Moslems.  The implications for the\\nmid-East, and even relations with American Moslems, could be quite\\nserious.\\n\",\n",

But do you really believe that this is the reason ?\\n|> Could you provide evidence that this is the case and that it\\n|> serves no other purpose ?\\n\\nA number of points.  You are making assumptions about the manner\\nin which the cards are used.  True, by law, all residents, citizens,\\nand tourists must carry a form of identification with them.  For\\ncitizens, the standard ID is the ID card.  The purpose this serves\\non a daily basis, wherein they are presented at public places,\\nis for the purpose of identifying the bearer.  This takes place\\nin banks (cashing checks), post offices (registered mail and such), etc...\\nQuite frankly, it was rare that I ever had to present my ID card\\nfor such activities more than once per week.  There is no law or\\nrequirement that forces people to wave their ID cards in public.\\nFurthermore, none of the services I outlined discriminate against\\nthe bearer in any manner by having access to this information.\\n\\nThe only case that I can think of in which the Le\\'um field might\\nbe taken into account is during interaction with the police,\\nbased upon the scenario.  In general though, arab citizens are\\nclearly recognizable, as are non-arabs. Your argument therefore\\nbecomes moot unless you can provide an example of how this field\\nis being used to discriminate against them officially.\\n\\n\\n|> In the answer to my second questions, concerning the fact that\\n|> Israel has no fixed borders, you state that Israel\\'s borders were\\n|> \\'shaped and reshaped by both war and peace\\'. According to what I\\n|> read, the first Zionists in the beginning of the Century, had\\n|> plans for the Jewish State to extend into what is Lebanon and into\\n|> Transjordan (Jordan).

Israel often claims it right of existence on the\\n|> fact that Jews lived there 2000 years ago or that God promised the\\n|> land to them. But according to biblical sources, the area God\\n|> promised would extend all the way to Iraq. And what were the\\n|> borders in biblical times which Israel considers proper to use\\n|> today ?  Finally, if Israel wants peace, why can\\'t it declare what\\n|> it considers its legitimate and secure borders, which might be a\\n|> base for negotiations? Having all the above facts in mind, one\\n|> cannot blame Arab countries to fear Israeli expansionism, as a\\n|> number of wars have proved (1948, 1956, 1967, 1982).\\n\\nI take issue with your assertions.  I think that Arab countries\\ndo know that they have nothing to fear from \"Israeli expansionism\".\\nMilitarily, Israel is not capable of holding onto large tracts of\\nland under occupation to a hostile, armed, and insurgent population for a\\nsustained period of time.  As is, the intifada is heavily taxing\\nthe Israeli economy.  Proof of this can be seen in the Israeli\\nwithdrawal from Lebanon.  Israeli troops pulled back from the\\nAwali, and later from the Litani, in order to control the minimal\\nstrip needed to keep towns out of range of Katyusha missile fire.\\nPublic opinion in Israel has turned towards settling the intifada\\nvia territorial concessions.  The Israel public is sufferring from\\nbattle fatigue of sorts and the gov\\'t is aware of it.\\n\\nWith regards to borders, let me state the following.  I may not agree\\nwith the manner in which negotiations are being held, however the crux\\nof the matter is that everyone either makes or refrains from stating\\na starting position.  The arab parties have called for total withdrawal\\nand a return to pre-48 borders.  If Israel were to state large borders,\\nthe negotiations might never get under way.  If Israel were to state\\nsmaller borders, then the arab countries might try and force even smaller\\nborders during the negotiations.  I think that leaving the matter to be\\nsettled by negotiations and peace treaties is infinitely more realistic\\nand sensible.\\n\\n|> Your answer to my third question is typical of a Stalinist public\\n|> official. I don\\'t think your answer is honest.  You refer me to\\n|> Vanunu\\'s revelations about Israel\\'s nuclear arsenal without\\n|> evaluating the truthfullness of his revelations. Now if he said\\n|> the truth, then why should he been punished, and if he lied, why\\n|> should he be punished?

As his guilt has not been established, it is\\nwrong for people to make postings based on this assumption.\\n\\n(b) Islam teaches us _not_ to harm innocents.  If Muslims -- who perhaps\\nhave not realized that Islam teaches this -- perform such actions, it is\\n_not_ _because_ of the teachings of Islam, but rather _in spite of_ and\\n_in contradiction to_ the  teachings of Islam.  This is an important \\ndistinction.\\n\\nI should clarify what Muslims usually mean when they say \"Muslim\".  In\\ngeneral, anyone who calls themselves a \"Muslim\" and does not do or \\noutwardly profess\\nsomething in clear contradiction with the essential teachings of Islam\\nis considered to be a Muslim.  Thus, one who might do things contrary to\\nIslam (through ignorance, for example) does not suddenly _not_ become a\\nMuslim.  If one knowingly transgresses Islamic teachings and essential\\nprinciples, though, then one does leave Islam.\\n\\nThe term \"Muslim\" is to be contrasted with \"Mu\\'min\", which means \"true\\nbeliever\".  However, whether a Muslim is in reality a Mu\\'min is\\nsomething known only by God (and perhaps that person himself).  So you\\nwill not find the term Mu\\'min used very much by Muslims in alt.atheism,\\nbecause it is not known to anybody (except myself and God), whether I,\\nfor example, am a \"true believer\" or not.  For example, I could just be\\nputting on a show here, and in reality believe something opposite to\\nwhat I write here, without anyone knowing.  Thus, when we say \"Muslims\"\\nwe mean all those who outwardly profess to follow Islam, whether in\\npractice they might, in ignorance, transgress Islamic teachings.  By\\n\"Muslim\" we do not necessarily mean \"Mu\\'min\", or \"true believer\" in\\nIslam.\\n\\n Fred Rice\\n darice@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au   \\n\\n',\n",

These young men are\\nsupported financially by Iran most of the time.  They sneak arms and\\nammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps\\nfor Israeli patrols.

We do not want to be occupied.  If Israel insists that\\nthe so called \"Security Zone\" is necessary for the protection of \\nNorthern Israel, than it will have to pay the price of its occupation\\nwith the blood of its soldiers.  If Israel is interested in peace,\\nthan it should withdraw from OUR land.  We are not asking for the \\nestablishment of a Lebanese occupied zone in northern Israel to protect\\nour villages that are attacked on a regular basis by Israel, so the\\nbest policy seems to be the removal of Israeli occupation and the\\nestablishment of peace keeping troops along the border.\\n\\nI have written before on this very newsgroup, that the only\\nreal solution will come as a result of a comprehensive peace\\nsettlement whereby Israel withdraws to its own borders and\\npeace keeping troops are stationed along the border to insure\\nno one on either side of the border is shelled.\\nThis is the only realistic solution, it is time for Israel to\\nrealize that the concept of a \"buffer zone\" aimed at protecting\\nits northern cities has failed.  In fact it has caused much more\\nIsraeli deaths than the occasional shelling of Northern Israel\\nwould have resulted in.  \\nIf Israel really wants to save some Israeli lives it would withdraw \\nunilaterally from the so-called \"Security Zone\" before the conclusion\\nof the peace talks.  Such a move would save Israeli lives,\\nadvance peace efforts, give Israel a great moral lift, better Israel\\'s \\npublic image abroad and give it an edge in the peace negociations \\nsince Israel can rightly claim that it is genuinely interested in \\npeace and has already offered some important concessions.\\nAlong with such a withdrawal Israel could demand that Hizbollah\\nbe disarmed by the Lebanese government and warn that it will not \\naccept any attacks against its northern cities and that if such a\\nshelling occurs than it will consider re-taking the buffer zone\\nand will hold the Lebanese and Syrian government responsible for it.\\nThere seems to be very little incentive for the Syrian and Lebanese\\ngoovernment to allow Hizbollah to bomb Israel proper under such \\ncircumstances, and now the Lebanese government has proven that it is\\ncapable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did\\nin all other parts of Lebanon.\\n  \\n|> If you ask me those questions, I will have no problem answering (not with a \\n|> question, as you did) : No, NOBODY is qualified candidate for murder, nothing\\n|> justifies murder.\\n\\nI agree, only in the case of the Isareli soldiers their killing\\nCANNOT be qualified as murder, no matter what you say.\\n\\n I have the feeling that you may be able yourself to make\\n|> similar statements, maybe after eliminating all Israelis, jews, ?

I argued this thoroughly about 3-4 weeks ago.  Men and women are\\ndifferent ... physically, physiologically, and psychologically.  Much\\nrecent evidence for this statement is present in the book \"Brainsex\" by\\nAnne Moir and David Jessel.  I recommend you find a copy and read it.\\nTheir book is an overview of recent scientific research on this topic\\nand is well referenced. \\n\\nNow, if women and men are different in some ways, the law can only\\nadequately take into account their needs in these areas where they are\\ndifferent by also taking into account the ways in which men and women\\nare different.  Maternity leave is an example of this -- it takes into\\naccount that women get pregnant.  It does not give women the same rules\\nit would give to men, because to treat women like it treats men in this\\ninstance would be unjust.  This is just simply an obvious example of\\nwhere men and women are intrinsically different!!!!!\\n\\nNow, people make the _naive_ argument that sexism = oppression.\\nHowever, maternity leave is sexist because MEN DO NOT GET PREGNANT. \\nMen do not have the same access to leave that women do (not to the same\\nextent or degree), and therefore IT IS SEXIST.  No matter however much a\\nman _wants_ to get pregnant and have maternity leave, HE NEVER CAN.  And\\ntherefore the law IS SEXIST.  No man can have access to maternity leave,\\nNO MATTER HOW HARD HE TRIES TO GET PREGNANT.  I hope this is clear.\\n\\nMaternity leave is an example where a sexist law is just, because the\\nsexism here just reflects the \"sexism\" of nature in making men and women\\ndifferent.  There are many other differences between men and women which\\nare far more subtle than pregnancy, and to find out more of these I\\nrecommend you have a look at the book \"Brainsex\".\\n\\nYour point that perhaps some day men can also be pregnant is fallacious.\\nIf men can one day become pregnant it will be by having biologically\\nbecome women!  To have a womb and the other factors required for\\npregnancy is usually wrapped up in the definition of what a woman is --\\nso your argument, when it is examined, is seen to be fallacious.  You\\nare saying that men can have the sexist maternity leave privilege that \\nwomen can have if they also become women -- which actually just supports\\nmy statement that maternity leave is sexist.\\n\\n>The discrimination comes in when a woman is denied opportunities\\n>because of her (legally determined) sexual inferiorities.  As I\\n>understand most religious sexual discrimination, and I doubt that\\n>Islam is exceptional, the female is not allowed into the priestly\\n>caste and in general is subjugated so that she has no aspirations to\\n>rights which, as an equal human, she ought to be entitled to.\\n\\nThere is no official priesthood in Islam -- much of this function is\\ntaken by Islamic scholars.  There are female Islamic scholars and\\nfemale Islamic scholars have always existed in Islam.  An example from\\nearly Islamic history is the Prophet\\'s widow, Aisha, who was recognized\\nin her time and is recognized in our time as an Islamic scholar.\\n\\n>No matter how sweetly you coat it, part of the role of religions\\n>seems, historically, to have served the function of oppressing the\\n>female, whether by forcing her to procreate to the extent where\\n>there is no opportunity for self-improvement, or by denying her\\n>access to the same facilities the males are offered.\\n\\nYou have no evidence for your blanket statement about all religions, and\\nI dispute it.

These people -- and those associated with them\\n    (\"Now there were with us seven brethren\", Matt. 22:25) -- would not\\n    be receptive to such higher blessings as eternal marriage.  Hence,\\n    the people in the story would likely not be married in the eterni-\\n    ties; but that doesn\\'t mean other, more faithful people could not\\n    have this blessing.\\n\\n(2) Jesus was making a distinction between the state or condition of\\n    =being= married, and the process of =becoming= married.  The latter\\n    activity (marrying and giving in marriage) will not take place in\\n    the eternities, because all eternal marriages will be taken care of\\n    before then.\\n\\n(3) The account as we have it (in all three of the synoptic Gospels) is\\n    missing something that would make its real meaning clearer.  Note\\n    that we (LDS) do not believe in Biblical inerrancy, so we do not in\\n    general feel obliged to reconcile each and every Bible text with\\n    modern revelation through Joseph Smith and other latter-day proph-\\n    ets.  Nor are we particularly upset that the account in question\\n    was not significantly revised in the \"Joseph Smith Translation\" or\\n    \"Inspired Version\" of the Bible, since we do not believe this work\\n    was completed or that failure to revise a passage in the JST con-\\n    stitutes divine approval of that passage as it stands in the KJV.\\n\\n-- \\nRich Wales <richw@mks.com>       //      Mortice Kern Systems Inc.

Patients are generally kept on steroids for\\nmonths before thinking about tapering.

Muggers using a gun rely primarily on the\\nthreat of the gun, and rarely shoot their victim. A mugger\\nusing a knife is much more likely to start by stabbing his victim \\nin an effort incapacitate him. So, while a knif may not\\nbe as deadly as a gun, criminals are more likely to actually\\n_use_ the knife (as opposed to threatening the victim with it.)\\nIt isn\\'t at all clear that replacing the criminal\\'s gun with a\\nknife would reduce murders. Stabbings might just become more\\ncommon. That\\'s why it is important to look at the overall\\n(not the with-gun) homicide rate. It avoids the issue of\\nsubstitution, different criminal techinques of using different\\nweapons, etc... and measures what we want to prevent: Murders.\\n\\n>As for knives, see my earlier post.

However, facing knife-welding attackers isn\\'t\\ntoo common: Stabbing without warning and by supprise is the\\nusual tactic.

Further, if you limit yourself to players who were a lot above\\nor below average in clutch situations (say, 1 standard deviation from \\nthe mean) more than one year, the random explanation still looks good.\\nIn the four years (\\'84-\\'87) that I looked at the data from Elias, there\\nwere 79 (29) players with a minimum of 25 (50) at bats in clutch \\nsituations that were 1 sigma from the mean two different years.  Of\\nthose 79 (29) players, 38 (14) of them changed sign between the two\\nyears.  In other words, they were great clutch hitters one year and\\nreally horrible the other year.

Both  families  agreed in  condemning  the Eutychian heresy. Both  families\\nconfess that the Logos, the Second Person  of the Holy  Trinity, only begotten\\nof the Father before the ages  and consubstantial with  Him, was incarnate and\\nwas born from the Virgin Mary Theotokos; fully consubstantial with us, perfect\\nman with soul, body and mind  ($  \\\\nu o  \\\\upsilon \\\\zeta $); He  was crucified,\\ndied, was  buried and rose  from the dead on  the third day, ascended   to the\\nHeavenly Father, where He sits on the right hand of the Father as  Lord of all\\ncreation. At  Pentecost, by the coming of  the  Holy Spirit He  manifested the\\nChurch as His Body. We look forward to His coming again in the fullness of His\\nglory, according to the Scriptures.\\n\\n2. Both  families condemn the  Nestorian heresy and the crypto-Nestorianism of\\nTheodoret of  Cyrus. They agree that it  is not sufficient merely  to say that\\nChrist is consubstantial both with His Father  and with us, by  nature God and\\nby nature man; it is necessary to affirm also that the Logos, Who is by nature\\nGod,  became by  nature   man, by His  incarnation  in the fullness  of  time.\\n\\n3. Both families agree  that the Hypostasis of the  Logos became  composite by\\nuniting to His divine uncreated nature with its natural will and energy, which\\nHe has  in common with  the Father and  the Holy Spirit, created human nature,\\nwhich He assumed  at the Incarnation  and made  His own, with its natural will\\nand energy.\\n\\n4. Both families agree  that the natures  with their proper energies and wills\\n   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nare united hypostatically and  naturally   without confusion, without  change,\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nwithout  division and without separation,  and that they are distinguished  in\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nthought alone.\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n5. Both families agree that He who wills and acts is always the one Hypostasis\\nof the Logos Incarnate.\\n\\n[...]\\n\\nI guess that adresses your question adequately.\\n\\nAs for your second set of questions, I am afraid they are irrelevant to the\\ndiscussion (at least from my point of view) of Monophysitism. I do not see\\nhow they relate to the topic we are discussing (other than to start an\\nendless Orthodox-RC debate which I do not plan to engage into).

In fact, your argument above is that kidney dialysis is a loss leader \\nfor other medical treatments where lost revenue can be regained.  \\n\\nBut the evidence does not support this contention.  Rather, it appears that\\nprice controls have disciplined the market by forcing an expansion of\\nservice and development of improved lower-cost technology to provide \\ncomparable benefits.  Providers continue to profit from RD, they simply\\nmake less on each treatment than they would have if the price had \\nrisen at the rate that uncontrolled treatments have.\\n\\nThere is no question that had price controls forced the price of RD \\nsubstantially below its actual cost that some or all of the doomsday\\npredictions of free-market advocates would have been seen -- restriction\\nof service, lagging technological development, etc.  Likewise, it appears\\nthat in the VA and armed forces medical care systems, where providers \\nare government agencies, some of these negative impacts may occur.  \\n(RD patients in the VA system in Spokane, for example, must travel to\\nSeattle, 300 miles away, for treatment.)  \\n\\nThe bottom line, however, is that this is an example of government \\nintervention (of a rather extreme sort) that appears to have had beneficial\\nresults for both providers and consumers.

If my application depends on modifiers, what is the best lookup method?\\nMy choices are to call XGetModifierMapping() for each key press with a \\nmodifier, or make the call once at the init of the app and store the modifiers\\nin a lookup table.  I would like to do it the second way, but I can't seem to\\nget the notify when the user uses xmodmap to remap the modifiers.  I know that\\nwhen an app calls XSetModifierMapping() a MappingNotify event is generated\\n(non-maskable) which I can pick up and modify my internal table.  But, I don't\\nseem to get any notify events when the user uses xmodmap.  If I use Xt, all \\nO'Reilly has to say is '...is automatically handled by Xt...'.  If I use Xlib, ala XNextEvent(), I get nothing.  This all stems from problems with users of \\nthe Sun 4/5 keyboard and the NumLock; plus various Alt/Meta/etc. modifier \\nrequirements.\\n\\n2.  I would like to place a popup so that it will be to the immediate right\\nof my main window.  I want it at the same y coord, and their right/left\\nsides touching.  What I need to ask for is the x,y coord of the window \\nmanager's border for the main window.  This should ring a bell with anyone\\nwho has called XtMoveWidget(), immediately checking the x,y after the move\\nand seeing that it is right, and in their next callback asking for the x,y\\nand seeing that it is now offset by the WM border.\\n\\nAny help would be most appreciated.\\n\\nDarcy\\ndarcy_mccallum@mentorg.com\\n\",\n",

Being a PhD-student at David\\nChaum's cryptography-group, our group has a long history in research\\nin the field of privacy-protecting cash systems.\\n\\nThe report is called CS-R9323.ps.Z, contains 77 pages, and can be\\nretrieved from\\n\\nftp.cwi.nl   (192.16.184.180)\\n\\nfrom the directory pub/CWIreports/AA.\\nThe postscript-file is suitable for 300dpi laserprinters.\\n\\n====================================================================\\nABSTRACT (from coverpage): We present a new off-line electronic cash\\nsystem based on a problem, called the representation problem, of which\\nlittle use has been made in literature thus far. Our system is the\\nfirst to be based entirely on discrete logarithms.  Using the\\nrepresentation problem as a basic concept, some techniques are\\nintroduced that enable us to construct protocols for withdrawal and\\npayment that do not use the cut and choose methodology of earlier\\nsystems. As a consequence, our cash system is much more efficient in\\nboth computation and communication complexity than any such system\\nproposed previously.\\n  \\nAnother important aspect of our system concerns its provability.\\nContrary to previously proposed systems, its correctness can be\\nmathematically proven to a very great extent. Specifically, if we\\nmake one plausible assumption concerning a single hash-function, the\\nability to break the system seems to imply that one can break the\\nDiffie-Hellman problem. \\n  \\nOur system offers a number of extensions that are hard to achieve in\\npreviously known systems. In our opinion the most interesting of these\\nis that the entire cash system (including all the extensions) can be\\nincorporated in a setting based on wallets with observers, which has\\nthe important advantage that double-spending can be prevented in the\\nfirst place, rather than detecting the identity of a double-spender\\nafter the fact. In particular, it can be incorporated even under the\\nmost stringent requirements conceivable about the privacy of the user,\\nwhich seems to be impossible to do with previously proposed systems.\\nAnother benefit of our system is that framing attempts by a bank have\\nnegligible probability of success (independent of computing power) by\\na simple mechanism from within the system, which is something that\\nprevious solutions lack entirely. Furthermore, the basic cash system\\ncan be extended to checks, multi-show cash and divisibility, while\\nretaining its computational efficiency.\\n====================================================================\\n\\nCryptographers are challenged to try to break this system!  \\n\\nI made a particular effort to keep the report as self-contained as\\npossible.  Nevertheless, if you have any questions, please e-mail to\\nme and I will try to reply as good as I can. Any comments are also\\nwelcome!\\n\\nStefan Brands, \\n--------------------------------------------------------\\nCWI, Kruislaan 413, 1098 SJ Amsterdam, The Netherlands \\nTel: +31 20 5924103, e-mail: brands@cwi.nl  \\n\",\n",

JPEG is designed for compressing either\\nfull-color or gray-scale digital images of \"natural\", real-world scenes.\\nIt does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line\\ndrawings.\\n\\nJPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it\\nhandle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types\\nof images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG\\nrespectively.\\n\\nJPEG is \"lossy\", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn\\'t\\nquite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much\\nof its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably\\nthe fact that small color details aren\\'t perceived as well as small details\\nof light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will\\nbe looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the\\nsmall errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are\\ninvisible to the eye.\\n\\nA useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by\\nadjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade\\noff file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small\\nfiles if you don\\'t mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image\\narchives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you\\naren\\'t happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you\\ncan jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.\\n\\n\\n[2]  Why use JPEG?\\n\\nThere are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store\\n24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.\\n\\nMaking image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across\\nnetworks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a\\n2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in\\ndisk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the\\nsize ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)\\n\\nIf your viewing software doesn\\'t support JPEG directly, you\\'ll have to\\nconvert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even\\nwith a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image\\nthan to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using\\nJPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to\\nstore or transmit an image more cheaply.\\n\\nIt\\'s worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the\\ntime savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the\\nextra time to decompress the file.  I\\'ll let you do the arithmetic yourself.\\n\\nThe other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet\\nposting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel\\n(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have\\nonly 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage\\nto you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as\\nblack-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed\\nin section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among\\npeople with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably\\nmore appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.\\n\\n\\n[3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?\\n\\nJPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images,\\nGIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first\\nthings to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.\\n\\nAs a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or\\ngray-scale images of \"realistic\" scenes; that means scanned photographs and\\nsimilar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don\\'t have 24-bit display\\nhardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)\\n\\nGIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors,\\nsuch as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels\\nthat are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed\\nby GIF.  JPEG can\\'t squeeze these files as much as GIF does without\\nintroducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form.\\n(In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they\\nshould be avoided in JPEG files.)\\n\\nJPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels\\nadjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to\\ncome out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this\\nsort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly\\noften in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is\\nparticularly objectionable with text that\\'s only a few pixels high.\\nIf you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don\\'t JPEG it.\\n\\nComputer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between\\nscanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and\\nsubtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it.\\nThe same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).\\n\\nPlain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG.\\nYou need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale\\nimages.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images\\nof up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.\\n\\nIf you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you\\nshould convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do.\\n(Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only\\napplies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from\\na GIF, you\\'ve already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG\\ncan only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify\\nconverting anyway.  This is a decision you\\'ll have to make for yourself.\\nIf you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be\\nprepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not\\nconvert well.\\n\\n\\n[4]  How well does JPEG compress images?\\n\\nPretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have\\nhandy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three\\nfiles are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG\\nsoftware described in section 6B.\\n\\nFile\\t   Size in bytes\\t\\tComments\\n\\nship.ppm\\t1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits\\n\\t\\t\\t or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead)\\nship.ppm.Z\\t 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress\\n\\t\\t\\t compress doesn\\'t accomplish a lot, you\\'ll note.\\n\\t\\t\\t Other text-oriented compressors give similar results.\\nship.gif\\t 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif\\n\\t\\t\\t Most of the savings is the result of losing color\\n\\t\\t\\t info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.

Still as good image quality as many\\n\\t\\t\\t recent postings in Usenet pictures groups.\\nship.jpg25\\t  25192  cjpeg -Q 25\\n\\t\\t\\t JPEG\\'s characteristic \"blockiness\" becomes apparent\\n\\t\\t\\t at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).\\n\\t\\t\\t Still, I\\'ve seen plenty of Usenet postings that were\\n\\t\\t\\t of poorer image quality than this.\\nship.jpg5o\\t   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)\\n\\t\\t\\t Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or\\n\\t\\t\\t indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:\\n\\t\\t\\t the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !\\n\\nIn this case JPEG can make a file that\\'s a factor of four or five smaller\\nthan a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the\\nGIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical\\nratio for real-world scenes.\\n\\n\\n[5]  What are good \"quality\" settings for JPEG?\\n\\nMost JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by\\nselecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about\\nthe meaning of these settings.  \"Quality 95\" does NOT mean \"keep 95% of the\\ninformation\", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary;\\nit\\'s not a percentage of anything.\\n\\nThe name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting\\n(smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from\\nthe original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one\\nobserver to another, but here are some rules of thumb.\\n\\nThe default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This\\nsetting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a\\ntypical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for\\nexperimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a\\nfile two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.\\n\\nIf the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to\\ngo down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you\\nmight need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation.\\nThe second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG.\\nThe default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to\\n95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).\\n\\nIf you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are\\nprepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is\\nabout right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as \"op art\".\\n\\n(Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG\\nsoftware described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other\\nJPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different\\nquality scale.  Some programs don\\'t even provide a numeric scale, just\\n\"high\"/\"medium\"/\"low\"-style choices.)\\n\\n\\n[6]  Where can I get JPEG software?\\n\\nMost of the programs described in this section are available by FTP.\\nIf you don\\'t know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article \"How to find sources\".\\n(If you don\\'t have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the\\nsame article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can\\nget it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with\\n\"send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources\" in the body.  The \"Anonymous FTP\\nList FAQ\" may also be helpful --- it\\'s usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in\\nthe news.answers archive.\\n\\nNOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple\\nmonths old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.\\n\\n\\n[6A]  If you are looking for \"canned\" software, viewers, etc:\\n\\nThe first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one\\nkind of system.  If you don\\'t see what you want for your machine, check out\\nthe portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this\\nlist concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over\\nInternet; but some commercial programs are listed too.\\n\\nX Windows:\\n\\nXV (shareware, $25) is an excellent viewer for JPEG, GIF, and many other\\nimage formats.  It can also do format conversion and some simple image\\nmanipulations.  It\\'s available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12),\\nfile contrib/xv-3.00.tar.Z.  Version 3.00 is a major upgrade with support\\nfor 24-bit displays and many other improvements; however, it is brand new\\nand still has some bugs lurking.  If you prefer not to be on the bleeding\\nedge, stick with version 2.21, also available from export.  Note that\\nversion 2.21 is not a good choice if you have a 24-bit display (you\\'ll get\\nonly 8-bit color), nor for converting 24-bit images to JPEG.  But 2.21 works\\nfine for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.  CAUTION: there is a\\nglitch in version 2.21: be sure to check the \"save at normal size\" checkbox\\nwhen saving a JPEG file, or the file will be blurry.\\n\\nAnother good choice for X Windows is John Cristy\\'s free ImageMagick package,\\nalso available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z.\\nThis package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The\\nImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped\\ndisplays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the\\nbasic free JPEG software.\\n\\nBoth of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple\\nimage viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest\\nrelease, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu,\\nfile contrib/xloadimage-3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage,\\nsaid by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original.\\n(The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current\\nxloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4\\ndecoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next\\nxloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from\\nexport.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said\\nto do the right thing with 24-bit displays.\\n\\n\\nMS-DOS:\\n\\nThis covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.\\n\\nOne good choice is Eric Praetzel\\'s free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files.\\nThe current version, 2.5, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca\\n(129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg25.zip.  This is a good basic\\nviewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is\\nnot flashy, but it\\'s functional.\\n\\nAnother freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei\\'s Hiview.  The\\ncurrent version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE\\nbelow), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU\\nand a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and\\nOS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no\\nbigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit\\non the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do).\\nYou may or may not prefer this approach, but there\\'s no denying that it\\nslows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a\\nbit tricky; read the directions carefully!\\n\\nA shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to\\ninstall than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is\\nalso much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use ---\\nmore keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a\\nlittle slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than\\nscreen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both\\nare faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from\\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip.\\nRequires a VESA graphics driver; if you don\\'t have one, look in vesadrv2.zip\\nor vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in\\nVESA driver, so don\\'t try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains\\nthat the driver is missing.)\\n\\nA second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around\\nthe net for a while, but I don\\'t know any stable archive location for it.\\nThe current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway.\\nThe author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly\\nand it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.\\n\\nThe well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest\\nrevision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW\\'s JPEG implementation isn\\'t very good:\\nit\\'s slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is\\npoor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it\\'d have been nice to see a\\ngood JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and\\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.\\n\\nDue to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these\\nviewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can\\'t get *any*\\nof them to work, you\\'ll need to use one of the following conversion programs\\nto convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you\\nhave hi-color hardware, don\\'t use GIF as the intermediate format; try to\\nfind a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right\\nthing with hi-color displays.)\\n\\nThe Independent JPEG Group\\'s free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20\\nand mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or\\njpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS\\ncompilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will\\nconvert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.\\n\\nHandmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF.\\nThese are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in\\nparticular, you can\\'t get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major\\nadvantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI\\'s proprietary\\nJPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format\\nfiles are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version\\n2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from\\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip.\\nNOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is\\nnot readable on non-PC platforms.\\n\\nHandmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation\\npackage, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI\\nformats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images.\\nA demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.2 is available from Simtel20 and\\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch162.zip.\\n\\nNOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet\\'s key archive site for PC-related programs\\nis Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20\\nruns a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document\\nrefers to directory (eg) \"msdos/graphics\" at Simtel20, that really means\\n\"pd1:<msdos.graphics>\".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should\\nexpect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several\\nInternet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives;\\nmost FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA\\nmirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files\\nin (eg) \"/pub/msdos/graphics\".  If you have no FTP capability, you can\\nretrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in\\ncomp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA,\\nconsult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.\\n\\nMicrosoft Windows:\\n\\nThere are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images.\\n(Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware,\\ndue to Windows\\' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion\\nprograms described above inside a Windows DOS window.)\\n\\nThe newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0\\nis available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip.\\nRequires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills\\nviewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it\\ndecodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers.\\nBut it\\'s so fast you\\'ll use it anyway, at least for previewing...\\n\\nJView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the\\ndecompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can\\'t create new JPEG\\nfiles, and it doesn\\'t view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful\\nfeatures of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it\\'s\\nan excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from\\nftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip.\\n(Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites,\\nincluding wuarchive.wustl.edu.)\\n\\nWinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files;\\nit can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter.\\nIt has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and\\nslideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror\\nsites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow\\n286-compatible version; if you register, you\\'ll get the 386-only version,\\nwhich is roughly 25% faster.)\\n\\nColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising\\ncontender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it\\nhas no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the\\ncurrent version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file\\npub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will\\nbe appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)\\n\\nDVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen\\nmode, not in a window.\\n\\nOS/2:\\n\\nThe following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151).\\nNote: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator\\nis not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories.\\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip\\n    32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4.\\n/pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip\\n    16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x.\\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc12.zip\\n    Image Archiver 1.02: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.\\n    Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.  Shareware, $15.\\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip\\n    PMJPEG 1.1: OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG, a popular viewer for Windows\\n    (see description in Windows section).  Shareware, $20.\\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview85.zip\\n    PMView 0.85: JPEG/GIF/BMP/Targa/PCX viewer.  GIF viewing very fast,\\n    JPEG viewing roughly the same speed as the above two programs.  Has\\n    image manipulation & slideshow functions.  Shareware, $20.\\n\\nMacintosh:\\n\\nMost Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple\\'s JPEG implementation, which is part of\\nthe QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed.\\nTo use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running\\nSystem 6.0.7 or later.  (If you\\'re running System 6, you must also install\\nthe 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get\\nQuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx.\\n(As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0\\nin several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and\\nconsiderably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However,\\nsome applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)\\n\\nMac users should keep in mind that QuickTime\\'s JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is\\nnot the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for\\ndetails.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format.\\nMost of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.\\n\\nThe first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images\\nthat are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can\\nconvert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big\\nimprovement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu\\n(36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and\\nQuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color\\nimage quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can\\nview large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it\\'s\\nthe only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a\\ntypical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down\\nto fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other\\nviewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people\\nlike this behavior, some don\\'t.  Overall, JPEGView\\'s user interface is very\\nwell thought out.\\n\\nGIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and\\nPICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest\\nversion is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\\n/info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later.\\nGIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but\\nit has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion\\ncapabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of\\nplaying around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can\\nload and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if\\nyour machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it\\'s faster with QuickTime.)\\nNote: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try\\nconverting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.\\n\\nJPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is\\navailable from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx.\\nThis will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing.\\nYou can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.\\n\\nPrevious versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF\\nconverter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this\\nprogram, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.\\n\\nApple\\'s free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and\\nGIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie\\nfrom ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx.\\nRequires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer\\'s tool, and it\\'s\\nreally not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime.\\nSome of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces\\nrelatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display,\\nand it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an\\nunsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not\\nintend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called\\nPICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash\\nit, as it\\'s even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much\\ncleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that\\nPicture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)\\n\\nStorm Technology\\'s Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter.\\nThis rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but\\nit will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on\\nolder systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can\\'t\\nuse it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\\n/info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a\\ndownloaded image file to \\'JPEG\\' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.\\n\\nIf your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance),\\nGIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you\\ndon\\'t want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.\\n\\nMore and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not\\nall can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version\\n2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG\\nplug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded\\nJPEG file to \\'JPEG\\' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.\\n\\nAmiga:\\n\\n(Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at\\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this\\narchive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good\\nchoice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)\\n\\nHamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a\\ngeneral image manipulation tool.  It\\'s cheap (shareware, $20) and can read\\nseveral formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version\\nis available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\\namiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger\\nthan 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.\\n\\nRend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM,\\nand GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even\\ncapturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The\\ncurrent version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror\\nsites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is\\nsupposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under\\nAmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)\\n\\nViewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04,\\navailable from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\\namiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.\\n\\nIf you\\'re willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages\\nthat support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24\\nand Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and\\nImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting,\\neffects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are\\ndistributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro),\\nfrom ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation\\nsoftware for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another\\nwell-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.\\n\\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from\\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file\\nAmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.\\n\\nThe Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many\\nbased on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks\\nto a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without\\nso much as notifying the authors).  Among these are \"AugJPEG\", \"NewAmyJPEG\",\\n\"VJPEG\", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion,\\nanything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space\\nit\\'s stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.\\n\\nAtari ST:\\n\\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc,\\nfrom atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo.\\nThese programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.\\n\\nFor monochrome ST monitors, try MGIF, which manages to achieve four-level\\ngrayscale effect by flickering.  Version 4.1 reads JPEG files.  Available\\nfrom atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/mgif41b.zoo.\\n\\nI have not heard of any other free or shareware JPEG-capable viewers for\\nAtaris, but surely there must be some by now?  Pointers appreciated.\\n\\nAcorn Archimedes:\\n\\n!ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view\\nJPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG,\\nalthough this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.\\n\\nRecent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle\\nJPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be\\nfound on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by\\nregistering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede,\\nThe Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).\\n\\nThere\\'s also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write\\nfunctionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image\\nformat conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not\\nnecessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST,\\nCambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.\\n\\nNeXT:\\n\\nImageViewer is a PD utility that displays images and can do some format\\nconversions.  The current version reads JPEG but does not write it.\\nImageViewer is available from the standard NeXT archives at\\nsonata.cc.purdue.edu and cs.orst.edu, somewhere in /pub/next (both are\\ncurrently being re-organized, so it\\'s hard to point to specific\\nsub-directories).  Note that there is an older version floating around that\\ndoes not support JPEG.\\n\\n\\nPortable software for almost any system:\\n\\nIf none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free\\nJPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You\\'ll also need a viewer program.\\nIf your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a\\ndisplay with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa\\nor PPM 24-bit image files.\\n\\nThere are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every\\nday.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find\\nthe available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case,\\npurchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether\\nthe product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can\\nhandle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are\\nnot and never will be compatible with anyone else\\'s files.\\n\\n\\n[6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:\\n\\nFree, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent\\nJPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code,\\ndocumentation, and some small test files is available from several places.\\nThe \"official\" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9\\nor 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current release\\nis jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; don\\'t forget to\\nretrieve in binary mode.)  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP.\\nIf you are on a PC and don\\'t know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you may\\nprefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE\\nabove), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available on\\nCompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip.\\nIf you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearest\\ncomp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34.\\n(If you don\\'t know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQ\\narticle \"How to find sources\", referred to at the top of section 6.)\\n\\nThe free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG \"JFIF\" format and image\\nfiles in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats.\\nThe core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other\\nprograms, such as image viewers.  The package is highly portable; we have\\ntested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays.\\n\\nWe have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use.\\nCompanies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products.\\nWe do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement in\\nproduct literature (see the README file in the distribution for details).\\nWe hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as with\\nanything that\\'s free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability.\\n\\nThe Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization; if you\\'d like to\\ncontribute to improving our software, you are welcome to join.\\n\\n\\n[7]  What\\'s all this hoopla about color quantization?\\n\\nMost people don\\'t have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware.\\nTypical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel, so it can display\\n256 or fewer distinct colors at a time.  To display a full-color image, the\\ncomputer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative\\ncolors.  This process is called \"color quantization\".  (This is something\\nof a misnomer, \"color selection\" would be a better term.  We\\'re stuck with\\nthe standard usage though.)\\n\\nClearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most\\nimages, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact\\non the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at\\nthe very lowest JPEG quality settings).\\n\\nSince JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display\\non 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for\\n*all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what\\ncomes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors.\\nThis happens because JPEG\\'s lossiness affects each pixel a little\\ndifferently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably\\ncome out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets \"smeared\"\\ninto a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to\\ndisplay a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image\\nsource.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.\\n\\n(Incidentally, because of this effect it\\'s nearly meaningless to talk about\\nthe number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count\\nthe number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you\\ndifferent results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see\\nposted images described as \"256-color JPEG\".  This tells me that the poster\\n(a) hasn\\'t read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF.\\nJPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but\\nnumber of colors just isn\\'t a useful concept for JPEG.)\\n\\nOn the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to\\n256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its\\npalette, and the format doesn\\'t allow more than 256 palette entries.)\\nFor purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the\\nsender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don\\'t have to.\\nThis is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you\\'re stuck with the sender\\'s\\nquantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than\\nwhat you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer\\nimage quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image.\\nFurthermore, if the sender didn\\'t use a high-quality color quantization\\nalgorithm, you\\'re out of luck.\\n\\nFor this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality\\nfor all users whose machines don\\'t match the sender\\'s display hardware.\\nJPEG\\'s full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user\\'s display\\nhardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future\\nimprovements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in\\nthis area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG\\nimages you already have.  With a GIF, you\\'re stuck forevermore with what was\\nsent.\\n\\nIt\\'s also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather\\nshoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA\\ndisplay, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you\\nneed to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color\\nquantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it\\'s\\nalso due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use\\nhigh quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in\\nnormal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be\\ndisplayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average\\nGIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!\\n\\nFinally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display\\nhardware already: 15-bit \"hi-color\" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on\\nworkstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already\\nobsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their\\ndisplay.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively.\\nThus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images\\nin a machine-independent fashion.\\n\\n\\n[8]  How does JPEG work?\\n\\nThe buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine\\ntransforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy\\ncoding.  This article\\'s long enough already, so I\\'m not going to say more\\nthan that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ.\\nThis is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files\\n/pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in\\nusing the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.\\n\\n\\n[9]  What about lossless JPEG?\\n\\nThere\\'s a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did\\ndefine a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the\\nfinal output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this\\nlossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG\\nalgorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few\\nimplementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.\\n\\nSaying \"-Q 100\" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image.\\nWhat it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient\\nquantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the\\ncolor subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say\\n\"-sample 1x1\" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial\\nJPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)\\n\\nEven with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG\\nalgorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in\\nvarious calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel\\nvalue; it\\'s highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye,\\nbut it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.\\n\\nAt this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps\\nhalf the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG\\nprovides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees\\nbit-for-bit accuracy.\\n\\nIf you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less\\nthan 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the\\nJBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG\\nlossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with\\n6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a\\nHuffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.\\n\\n\\n[10]  Why all the argument about file formats?\\n\\nStrictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms;\\nit does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was\\nprevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international\\nstandards organizations.\\n\\nSince we can\\'t actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on\\na common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of\\nofficial standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to\\n\"do their own thing\", and as a result their programs aren\\'t compatible with\\nanybody else\\'s.\\n\\nThe closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work\\nthat\\'s been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined\\ntwo JPEG-based file formats:\\n  * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a \"low-end\" format that transports\\n    pixels and not much else.\\n  * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is\\n    a \"high-end\" format that will let you record just about everything you\\n    ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is\\n    a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,\\n    because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different\\n    and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It\\'s not likely that adding JPEG to the\\n    mix will do anything to improve this situation.\\nBoth of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors\\nof JPEG-related products; it\\'s reasonably likely that future commercial\\nproducts will adhere to one or both standards.\\n\\nI believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in\\npicture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the\\nTIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still\\nunusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well\\ndefined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported \"lowest common\\ndenominator\"; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.\\n\\nA particular case that people may be interested in is Apple\\'s QuickTime\\nsoftware for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped\\ninside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and\\nQuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are\\navailable to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor\\nthat handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF\\nby hand; see section 11 for details.\\n\\nAnother particular case is Handmade Software\\'s programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and\\nImage Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF\\nformat.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by\\nHSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be\\nused for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This\\napplies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF\\nformat by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format\\nfiles, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)\\n\\n\\n[11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?\\n\\nIf you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won\\'t read, it\\'s likely\\nto be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell\\nwhat you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:\\n\\n1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,\\n    followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by \\'JFIF\\'.\\n\\n2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a\\n    \"raw JPEG\" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---\\n    it\\'s worth a try, anyway.\\n\\n3.  HSI files start with \\'hsi1\\'.  You\\'re out of luck unless you have HSI\\n    software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they\\n    won\\'t decompress properly with non-HSI programs.\\n\\n4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred\\n    bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for \\'JFIF\\').  Strip off\\n    everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.\\n\\n5.  Anything else: it\\'s a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are\\n    lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.\\n    If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),\\n    try stripping off everything before that.\\n\\nIn uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is\\n\\n\\t\"begin\" line\\n\\tM_]C_X ...\\n\\nwhereas uuencoded HSI files will start with\\n\\n\\t\"begin\" line\\n\\tM:\\'-I ...\\n\\nIf you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of\\ndownloading non-JFIF files.\\n\\n\\n[12]  What about arithmetic coding?\\n\\nThe JPEG spec defines two different \"back end\" modules for the final output\\nof compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed.\\nThe choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually\\nproduces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding\\nproduces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the\\nfile-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)\\n\\nUnfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the\\nJPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.\\nThus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses\\nfrom these companies.  (The \"fair use\" doctrine allows people to implement\\nand test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious\\nat best.)\\n\\nAt least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about\\narithmetic coding; the space savings isn\\'t great enough to justify the\\npotential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not*\\nbe used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.\\n\\nThere is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the\\nfuture.  Stay tuned for further details.\\n\\n\\n[13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?\\n\\nIt would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could\\ndecompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it\\nwithout any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially.\\nUnfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered\\nimage loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the\\nfirst time around.\\n\\nThe next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress\\nit *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an\\nidentical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current\\nfree JPEG software.  It\\'s essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff\\nerror.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually\\ndegrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation\\noutput.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.)\\nOne of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can\\nbe avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.\\n\\nIn any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that\\ncompressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original\\nquality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes\\nas cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation.\\n(If you\\'re wondering why, it\\'s because the pixel-block boundaries move.\\nIf you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but\\nthat\\'s a mighty limited capability!)\\n\\nThe bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and\\ntransmission of images, but you don\\'t want to use it as an intermediate\\nformat for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format\\n(PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are\\nready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot\\nof compression/decompression time this way :-).\\n\\n\\n[14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?\\n\\nAs stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you\\nconvert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original\\nfull-color data the GIF was made from, it\\'s far better to make a JPEG from\\nthat.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from,\\nhere are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum\\nloss of quality.\\n\\nThe first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to\\nmake sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF;\\nthat will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality\\nsetting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in\\nsection 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors\\ndon\\'t convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality\\nwill be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)\\n\\nExperience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best\\ncandidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer\\nthe most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation.\\nDon\\'t waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don\\'t\\nexpect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created\\ndirectly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have\\nto let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through\\nJPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file,\\nnot 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).\\n\\nMany people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color\\nborder around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of\\nstorage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp\\nborder boundary can create visible artifacts (\"ghost\" edges).  Do yourself\\na favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows\\nsystem, XV\\'s manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless\\nway to do this.)\\n\\ncjpeg\\'s default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but\\nfor GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid\\nimage degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher\\nQ setting may not be necessary.)\\n\\nColor GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually \"dithered\" to fool\\nyour eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store.\\nIf you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of\\nsignificantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels\\ntogether to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The\\ntrouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency\\ncolor noise; and JPEG can\\'t compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG\\nfile is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have\\ngotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it).\\nTo get around this, you want to \"smooth\" the GIF image before compression.\\nSmoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that\\nyou thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid\\ncolor changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will\\noften let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of\\nthe compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image\\nthan you\\'d get without smoothing.\\n\\nWith the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing\\ncapability is built in.  Try \"-smooth 10\" or so when converting GIFs.\\nValues of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed\\ndithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular\\nfine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong\\nsmoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur\\nthe output image, which you don\\'t want.  If you are an image processing\\nwizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as\\npnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg\\'s built-in smoother is\\na LOT faster than pnmconvol...\\n\\nThe upshot of all this is that \"cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10\" is probably a\\ngood starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the\\nimage, you\\'ll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.\\n\\n\\n---------------------\\n\\nFor more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in\\nparticular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.\\n\\n-- \\n\\t\\t\\ttom lane\\n\\t\\t\\torganizer, Independent JPEG Group\\nInternet: tgl@cs.cmu.edu\\tBITNET: tgl%cs.cmu.edu@carnegie\\n',\n",

During the Russian occupation of Erzurum, no Armenian\\n was permitted to approach the city and its environs.\\n\\n While the Commander of the First Army Corps, General Kaltiyin remained\\n in power, troops including Armenian enlisted men, were not sent to the\\n area. When the security measures were lifted, the Armenians began to \\n attack Erzurum and its surroundings. Following the attacks came the\\n plundering of the houses in the city and the villages and the murder\\n of the owners of these houses...Plundering was widely committed by\\n the soldiers. This plunder was mainly committed by Armenian soldiers\\n who had remained in the rear during the war.\\n\\n One day, while passing through the streets on horseback, a group of\\n soldiers including an Armenian soldier began to drag two old men of\\n seventy years in a certain direction. The roads were covered with mud,\\n and these people were dragging the two helpless Turks through the mud\\n and dirt...\\n\\n It was understood later that all these were nothing but tricks and\\n traps. The Turks who joined the gendarmarie soon changed their minds\\n and withdrew. The reason was that most of the Turks who were on night\\n patrol did not return, and no one knew what had happened to them. The \\n Turks who had been sent outside the city for labour began to disappear\\n also. Finally, the Court Martial which had been established for the\\n trials of murderers and plunderers, began to liquidate itself for\\n fear that they themselves would be punished. The incidents of murder\\n and rape, which had decreased, began to occur more frequently.\\n\\n Sometime in January and February, a leading Turkish citizen Haci Bekir\\n Efendi from Erzurum, was killed one night at his home. The Commander\\n in Chief (Odiselidge) gave orders to find murderers within three days.\\n The Commander in Chief has bitterly reminded the Armenian intellectuals\\n that disobedience among the Armenian enlisted men had reached its\\n highest point, that they had insulted and robbed the people and half\\n of the Turks sent outside the city had not returned.\\n\\n ...We learnt the details this incident from the Commander-in-Chief,\\n Odishelidge. They were as follows:\\n\\n The killings were organized by the doctors and the employers, and the\\n act of killing was committed solely by the Armenian renegades...\\n More than eight hundred unarmed and defenceless Turks have been\\n killed in Erzincan. Large holes were dug and the defenceless \\n Turks were slaughtered like animals next to the holes. Later, the\\n murdered Turks were thrown into the holes. The Armenian who stood \\n near the hole would say when the hole was filled with the corpses:\\n \\'Seventy dead bodies, well, this hole can take ten more.\\' Thus ten\\n more Turks would be cut into pieces, thrown into the hole, and when\\n the hole was full it would be covered over with soil.\\n\\n The Armenians responsible for the act of murdering would frequently\\n fill a house with eighty Turks, and cut their heads off one by one.\\n Following the Erzincan massacre, the Armenians began to withdraw\\n towards Erzurum... The Armenian renegades among those who withdrew\\n to Erzurum from Erzincan raided the Moslem villages on the road, and\\n destroyed the entire population, together with the villages.\\n\\n During the transportation of the cannons, ammunition and the carriages\\n that were outside the war area, certain people were hired among the \\n Kurdish population to conduct the horse carriages. While the travellers\\n were passing through Erzurum, the Armenians took advantage of the time\\n when the Russian soldiers were in their dwellings and began to kill\\n the Kurds they had hired. When the Russian soldiers heard the cries\\n of the dying Kurds, they attempted to help them. However, the \\n Armenians threatened the Russian soldiers by vowing that they would\\n have the same fate if they intervened, and thus prevented them from\\n acting. All these terrifying acts of slaughter were committed with\\n hatred and loathing.\\n\\n Lieutenant Medivani from the Russian Army described an incident that\\n he witnessed in Erzurum as follows: An Armenian had shot a Kurd. The\\n Kurd fell down but did not die. The Armenian attempted to force the\\n stick in his hand into the mouth of the dying Kurd. However, since\\n the Kurd had firmly closed his jaws in his agony, the Armenian failed\\n in his attempt. Having seen this, the Armenian ripped open the abdomen\\n of the Kurd, disembowelled him, and finally killed him by stamping\\n him with the iron heel of his boot.\\n\\n Odishelidge himself told us that all the Turks who could not escape\\n from the village of Ilica were killed. Their heads had been cut off\\n by axes. He also told us that he had seen thousands of murdered\\n children. Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov, who passed through the village\\n of Ilica, three weeks after the massacre told us the following:\\n\\n There were thousands of dead bodies hacked to pieces, on the roads.\\n Every Armenian who happened to pass through these roads, cursed and\\n spat on the corpses. In the courtyard of a mosque which was about\\n 25x30 meter square, dead bodies were piled to a height of 140 \\n centimeters. Among these corpses were men and women of every age,\\n children and old people. The women\\'s bodies had obvious marks of\\n rape. The genitals of many girls were filled with gun-powder.\\n\\n A few educated Armenian girls, who worked as telephone operators\\n for the Armenian troops were called by Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov\\n to the courtyard of the mosque and he bitterly told them to be \\n proud of what the Armenians had done. To the lieutenant colonel\\'s\\n disgusted amazement, the Armenian girls started to laugh and giggle,\\n instead of being horrified. The lieutenant colonel had severely\\n reprimanded those girls for their indecent behaviour. When he told\\n the girls that the Armenians, including women, were generally more\\n licentious than even the wildest animals, and that their indecent\\n and shameful laughter was the most obvious evidence of their inhumanity\\n and barbarity, before a scene that appalled even veteran soldiers,\\n the Armenian girls finally remembered their sense of shame and\\n claimed they had laughed because they were nervous.\\n\\n An Armenian contractor at the Alaca Communication zone command\\n narrated the following incident which took place on February 20:\\n\\n The Armenians had nailed a Turkish women to the wall. They had cut\\n out the women\\'s heart and placed the heart on top of her head.\\n The great massacre in Erzurum began on February 7... The enlisted men \\n of the artillery division caught and stripped 270 people. Then they\\n took these people into the bath to satisfy their lusts. 100 people\\n among this group were able to save their lives as the result of\\n my decisive attempts. The others, the Armenians claimed, were \\n released when they learnt that I understood what was going on. \\n Among those who organized this treacherous act was the envoy to the\\n Armenian officers, Karagodaviev. Today, some Turks were murdered\\n on the streets.\\n\\n On February 12, some Armenians have shot more than ten innocent\\n Moslems. The Russian soldiers who attempted to save these people were\\n threatened with death. Meanwhile I imprisoned an Armenian for\\n murdering an innocent Turk. \\n\\n When an Armenian officer told an Armenian murderer that he would \\n be hanged for his crime, the killer shouted furiously: \\'How dare\\n you hang an Armenian for killing a Turk?\\' In Erzurum, the \\n Armenians burned down the Turkish market. On February 17, I heard\\n that the entire population of Tepekoy village, situated within\\n the artillery area, had been totally annihilated. On the same \\n day when Antranik entered Erzurum, I reported the massacre to\\n him, and asked him to track down the perpetrators of this horrible\\n act. However no result was achieved.\\n\\n In the villages whose inhabitants had been massacred, there was a\\n natural silence. On the night of 26/27 February, the Armenians deceived\\n the Russians, perpetrated a massacre and escaped for fear of the \\n Turkish soldiers. Later, it was understood that this massacre had\\n been based upon a method organized and planned in a circular. \\n The population had been herded in a certain place and then killed\\n one by one. The number of murders committed on that night reached\\n three thousand. It was the Armenians who bragged to about the details\\n of the massacre. The Armenians fighting against the Turkish soldiers\\n were so few in number and so cowardly that they could not even\\n withstand the Turkish soldiers who consisted of only five hundred\\n people and two cannons, for one night, and ran away. The leading\\n Armenians of the community could have prevented this massacre.\\n However, the Armenian intellectuals had shared the same ideas with\\n the renegades in this massacre, just as in all the others. The lower\\n classes within the Armenian community have always obeyed the orders\\n of the leading Armenian figures and commanders. \\n\\n I do not like to give the impression that all Armenian intellectuals\\n were accessories to these murders. No, for there were people who\\n opposed the Armenians for such actions, since they understood that\\n it would yield no result. However, such people were only a minority.\\n Furthermore, such people were considered as traitors to the Armenian\\n cause. Some have seemingly opposed the Armenian murders but have\\n supported the massacres secretly. Some, on the other hand, preferred\\n to remain silent. There were certain others, who, when accused by\\n the Russians of infamy, would say the following: \\'You are Russians.\\n You can never understand the Armenian cause.\\' The Armenians had a\\n conscience. They would commit massacres and then would flee in fear\\n of the Turkish soldiers.\\n\\n The incidents that occurred only recently clearly manifest the real\\n nature of the Armenian ideology.

From the outset,\\nthe efforts of the Armenian revolutionaries within the Ottoman borders took\\nthe form of terrorist and destructive actions aimed at mass murder, cruelty\\nand genocide, so that no other interpretation of them is possible. Armenian\\nactivities started during the reign of Abdulhamid II as individual acts of\\nterror, and then developed into assassinations and surprise attacks. The element\\nof brute force in these activities increased steadily, culminating in mass\\nrebellions and widespread fighting during the First World War. Furthermore,\\nwhen the Ottoman army withdrew from Eastern Anatolia after the 1915 Sarikamis\\ndefeat, Armenian revolutionaries initiated a series of cruelties in this area.\\nAlthough the Russians occupied Eastern Anatolia as an enemy, nevertheless they\\nwere constrained by the rules of war. However, when they returned to their\\ncountry in 1917 after the Revolution, Armenian revolutionaries were unchecked\\nin this area for about a year until the Ottoman forces returned to Erzurum\\nin 1918. During this period, Armenian revolutionaries executed massacres on\\nthe local people which is recorded in historical documents.[1]\\n\\nFor example, let us look at a report dated 21 March 1918 which the Commander\\nof the Third Army submitted when he entered Erzurum and Erzincan: \\n\\n \"They were completely and systematically destroyed and burned down \\n  by Armenians, even the trees were cut down, and they are like a \\n  building entirely consumed by fire in every sense of the word.\" \\n\\nAs for the people who had been living in Erzurum and Erzincan:\\n\\n\"Those who were capable of fighting were taken away at the very beginning\\n with the excuse of forced labor in road construction, they were taken\\n in the direction of Sarikamis and annihilated.

Still) embraced both diet and \\nmanipulation to set himself apart from the MD\\'s of his time who were pushing \\nonly drugs(Still was himself an MD who got real dissillusioned with drugs \\nduring his service in the Civil War).  He decided that there had to be a \\nbetter way to treat human disease since he saw the cure(drugs) as being \\nworse than the disease.

When I talked about people who rejected Trinitarian\\nlanguage as unBiblical, I was speaking of Trinitarian theology, things\\nlike \"one essense and three persons\".  Obviously the three-fold\\nbaptismal formula is Biblical, as you point out.  (I normally use the\\nterm \"three-fold\" in referring to Mat.  While it is certainly\\nconsistent with belief in the Trinity, the Trinity is a doctrine whose\\nfull formulation occurred in the 4th and 5th Cent\\'s.  It\\'s unlikely\\nthat Mat. had in mind the fully-developed Trinitarian doctrine.\\nIndeed the three-fold baptismal formula is used by some groups that do\\nnot believe in the Trinity.)  The disagreement over baptismal formulae\\noccurs because of passages such as Acts 2:38, which command baptism in\\nthe name of Jesus.  (There are a couple of other passages in Acts as\\nwell.)  This leaves us with sort of a problem: we\\'re commanded in Mat.\\nto baptize in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit,\\nand in Acts to baptize in the name of Jesus.\\n\\n\"Jesus only\" groups baptize in the name of Jesus.  They consider this\\nconsistent with Mat 28:18, because they say that Jesus is the name of\\nthe Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.  I\\'m not the right one to\\nask to explain what this means.  I will simply say that it does not\\nappear to be normal Trinitarian theology.  (It is also an odd way of\\ndealing with the idiomatic phrase \"in the name of\".)\\n\\nThose who use the three-fold formula don\\'t seem to have a standard\\nanswer to the passages talking about baptizing in the name of Jesus.\\nI suspect that the most common explanation is to say that \"in the name\\nof\" need not be a verbal formula.  To say that you baptize in the name\\nof Jesus may simply mean that you are doing baptism under Jesus\\'\\nauthority.  In the 1st Cent. context, it contrasts Christian baptism\\nwith the baptism of John or other Jewish baptism.  Of course there\\'s a\\ncertain parallelism between these passages.  That suggests that we\\ncould just as well say that Mat 28:18 doesn\\'t require the specific\\nthree-fold formula to be used in baptism, but simply characterizes\\nbaptism done by those who follow the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.\\n\\nOne might well suspect that in the early church, more than one\\nbaptismal formula was used.  So long as we consider following Jesus to\\nbe the same as following the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, no great\\ndamage would be done by such a difference.  This does *not* mean that\\nI think we should go back to using both formulae.  Baptism is one of\\nthe few things that almost all Christian groups now recognize\\nmutually, so I do not think doing something to upset that would be in\\nthe interests of the Gospel.  This is reinforced by the fact that\\nthose groups that actually use \"in the name of Jesus\" now do seem to\\nhave in mind a difference in doctrine.  But as I\\'ve said before, I\\'m\\nnot the one to explain what their doctrine is.\\n\\n--clh]\\n',\n",

Friday local Tel Aviv\\'s\\npaper, affiliated with Maariv.\\n\\nDate: 19 February 1993\\n\\nJournalist: Guy Ehrlich\\n\\nSubject: Interview with soldiers who served in the Duvdevan\\n(Cherry) units, which disguise themselves as Arabs and operate\\nwithin the occupied territories.\\n\\nExcerpts from the article:\\n\\n\"A lot has been written about the units who disguise themselves as\\nArabs, things good and bad, some of the falsehoods. But the most\\nimportant problem of those units has been hardly dealt with. It is\\nthat everyone who serves in the Cherry, after a time goes in one\\nway or another insane\".\\n\\nA man who said this, who will here be called Danny (his full name\\nis known to the editors) served in the Cherry. After his discharge\\nfrom the army he works as delivery boy. His pal, who will here be\\ncalled Dudu was also serving in the Cherry, and is now about to\\ndepart for a round-the-world tour. They both look no different\\nfrom average Israeli youngsters freshly discharged from conscript\\nservice. But in their souls, one can notice something completely\\ndifferent....It was not easy for them to come out with disclosures\\nabout what happened to them. And they think that to most of their\\nfellows from the Cherry it woundn\\'t be easy either. Yet after they\\nbegan to talk, it was nearly impossible to make them stop talking.\\nThe following article will contain all the horror stories\\nrecounted with an appalling openness.\\n\\n(...) A short time ago I was in command of a veteran team, in\\nwhich some of the fellows applied for release from the Cherry. We\\ncalled such soldiers H.I. \\'Hit by the Intifada\\'. Under my command\\nwas a soldier who talked to himself non-stop, which is a common\\nphenomenon in the Cherry. I sent him to a psychiatrist. But why I\\nshould talk about others when I myself feel quite insane ? On\\nFridays, when I come home, my parents know I cannot be talked to\\nuntil I go to the beach, surf a little, calm down and return. The\\nkeys of my father\\'s car must be ready for in advance, so that I\\ncan go there. I they dare talk to me before, or whenever I don\\'t\\nwant them to talk to me, I just grab a chair and smash it\\ninstantly. I know it is my nerve:  Smashing chairs all the time\\nand then running away from home, to the car and to the beach. Only\\nthere I become normal.(...)\\n\\n(...) Another friday I was eating a lunch prepared by my mother.\\nIt was an omelette of sorts. She took the risk of sitting next to\\nme and talking to me. I then told my mother about an event which\\nwas still fresh in my mind. I told her how I shot an Arab, and how\\nexactly his wound looked like when I went to inspect it. She began\\nto laugh hysterically. I wanted her to cry, and she dared laugh\\nstraight in my face instead ! So I told her how my pal had made a\\nmincemeat of the two Arabs who were preparing the Molotov\\ncocktails. He shot them down, hitting them beautifully, exactly as\\nthey deserved. One bullet had set a Molotov cocktail on fire, with\\nthe effect that the Arab was burning all over, just beautifully. I\\nwas delighted to see it.  My pal fired three bullets, two at the\\nArab with the Molotov cocktail, and the third at his chum. It hit\\nhim straight in his ass. We both felt that we\\'d pulled off\\nsomething.\\n\\nNext I told my mother how another pal of mine split open the guts\\nin the belly of another Arab and how all of us ran toward that\\nspot to take a look. I reached the spot first. And then that Arab,\\nblood gushing forth from his body, spits at me. I yelled: \\'Shut\\nup\\' and he dared talk back to me in Hebrew! So I just laughed\\nstraight in his face. I am usually laughing when I stare at\\nsomething convulsing right before my eyes. Then I told him: \\'All\\nright, wait a moment\\'. I left him in order to take a look at\\nanother wounded Arab. I asked a soldier if that Arab could be\\nsaved, if the bleeding from his artery could be stopped with the\\nhelp of a stone of something else like that. I keep telling all\\nthis to my mother, with details, and she keeps laughing straight\\ninto my face. This infuriated me. I got very angry, because I felt\\nI was becoming mad. So I stopped eating, seized the plate with he\\nomelette and some trimmings still on, and at once threw it over\\nher head. Only then she stopped laughing. At first she didn\\'t know\\nwhat to say.\\n\\n(...) But I must tell you of a still other madness which falls\\nupon us frequently. I went with a friend to practice shooting on a\\nfield. A gull appeared right in the middle of the field. My friend\\nshot it at once. Then we noticed four deer standing high up on the\\nhill above us. My friend at once aimed at one of them and shot it.\\nWe enjoyed the sight of it falling down the rock. We shot down two\\ndeer more and went to take a look. When we climbed the rocks we\\nsaw a young deer, badly wounded by our bullet, but still trying to\\nsuch some milk from its already dead mother. We carefully\\ninspected two paths, covered by blood and chunks of torn flesh of\\nthe two deer we had hit. We were just delighted by that sight. We\\nhad hit\\'em so good ! Then we decided to kill the young deer too,\\nso as spare it further suffering. I approached, took out my\\nrevolver and shot him in the head several times from a very short\\ndistance. When you shoot straight at the head you actually see the\\nbullets sinking in.  But my fifth bullet made its brains fall\\noutside onto the ground, with the effect of splattering lots of\\nblood straight on us. This made us feel cured of the spurt of our\\nmadness. Standing there soaked with blood, we felt we were like\\nbeasts of prey. We couldn\\'t explain what had happened to us. We\\nwere almost in tears while walking down from that hill, and we\\nfelt the whole day very badly.\\n\\n(...) We always go back to places we carried out assignments in.\\nThis is why we can see them. When you see a guy you disabled, may\\nbe for the rest of his life, you feel you got power. You feel\\nGodlike of sorts.\"\\n\\n(...) Both Danny and Dudu contemplate at least at this moment\\nstudying the acting. Dudu is not willing to work in any\\nsecurity-linked occupation. Danny feels the exact opposite. \\'Why\\nshouldn\\'t I take advantage of the skills I have mastered so well ?\\nWhy shouldn\\'t I earn $3.000 for each chopped head I would deliver\\nwhile being a mercenary in South Africa ? This kind of job suits\\nme perfectly. I have no human emotions any more. If I get a\\nreasonable salary I will have no problem to board a plane to\\nBosnia in order to fight there.\"\\n\\nTransl. by Israel Shahak.\\n\\n',\n",
